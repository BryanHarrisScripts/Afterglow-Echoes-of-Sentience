# Story Bible

In Hollywood, a "show bible" or "story bible" is often used during the development of a television show, movie, or even a novel. It serves as a reference document that provides a comprehensive overview of the characters, settings, plots, and other important details of the story. For some projects, this bible can be a living document, meaning that it gets updated as the project develops.

While there's no standard format for a show bible, it typically contains the following:

1. **Logline**: A one- or two-sentence summary of the story. It should capture the essence of the story in a succinct way.

2. **Overview/Summary**: A brief summary of the show or movie concept that provides more detail than the logline. It usually includes the genre, setting, and basic premise of the story.

3. **Pilot Synopsis**: A detailed summary of the first episode or the film's plot. It gives a clear picture of the story arc and hooks.

4. **Character Descriptions**: Detailed profiles of each main character. This can include their backgrounds, motivations, relationships, and any other relevant information.

5. **Episode Outlines/Synopses**: For TV shows, this section contains brief outlines or synopses for several episodes, demonstrating the progression of the storyline.

6. **World-building/Setting**: Descriptions of the world in which the story takes place. This can include the time period, location, society, culture, technology level, and any other relevant details.

7. **Tone/Style**: An explanation of the show or movie's tone and style. This includes aspects like pacing, humor, seriousness, realism, etc.

8. **Themes**: An exploration of the themes the show or movie will delve into.

9. **Visual Elements**: Concept art, storyboards, or other visual elements that help to convey the look and feel of the show or movie.

10. **Production Plan**: This can include a schedule, budget, and details about the production team. 

11. **Marketing and Audience**: An analysis of the target audience and potential marketing strategies.

12. **Future Seasons or Sequels**: Ideas for where the show or film could go in future seasons or sequels, demonstrating potential for longevity.

In addition to the bible, Hollywood also reviews scripts and pitch documents. A pitch is a verbal (and sometimes visual) presentation where you propose the idea for the show or movie to potential buyers. 

Remember, the goal of these documents is not just to explain the story but to sell it. You need to demonstrate why your story is unique and why an audience would want to watch it.
