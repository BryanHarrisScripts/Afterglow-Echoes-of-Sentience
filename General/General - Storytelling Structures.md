# The Diversity of Structures

### From Screenplays to Improv 

Storytelling, as an integral part of human communication, manifests in a multitude of formats. Beyond the realm of improvisation and screenplays, there exists a cornucopia of mediums, each with unique rules, conventions, and formats for scripting and storytelling. This blog post aims to delve into these diverse formats to facilitate a broader understanding for educators, students, and hobbyists alike.

## Storytelling Mediums

1. **Stage Plays**: Scripts crafted for live theatre vary in size from one-act plays to full-length productions. Unlike screenplays, play scripts place a greater emphasis on dialogue rather than visual elements.

2. **Novels and Short Stories**: These written prose forms offer more scope for interior monologue and exposition. Their structure can range from the simple to the complex, per the author's discretion.

3. **Poetry**: Often abstract, focusing on language and emotion, poetry tells a story in a highly condensed form.

4. **Radio Plays/Podcasts**: The resurgence of podcasts underscores the vitality of audio storytelling. The scripting for these formats, akin to screenplays, concentrates solely on the audio experience.

5. **Graphic Novels and Comic Books**: These visual storytelling mediums amalgamate elements of prose and screenwriting, with an accent on the visual art.

6. **Video Games**: Many contemporary video games feature intricate stories, complete with scripted dialogue and events. These scripts, similar to screenplays, also account for interactive elements and varying outcomes based on player choices.

7. **Web Series**: These scripted videos released online often share the script format with screenplays or TV scripts.

8. **Music**: In formats like Operas, Musicals, Concept Albums, and Music Videos, the story is narrated through a blend of music, lyrics, and occasionally scripted dialogue or visual elements.

9. **Animations**: Scripts for this medium resemble screenplays but must also include descriptions of visual elements and actions set for animation.

10. **Non-Fiction**: In formats such as Biography, Documentary, and News Reporting, storytelling, while adhering to facts, employs many of the same narrative structures and techniques.

## Improvisational Theatre Structures

Improvisational theatre, akin to scripted theatre or film, offers a variety of structures:

1. **Armando**: This format begins with a monologue which inspires the following scenes.

2. **La Ronde**: Each scene introduces one character from the preceding scene and one new character, creating a "round" of interconnected scenes.

3. **Living Room**: This format commonly starts with an informal conversation among the players, serving as a springboard for scene ideas.

4. **Mono Scene**: The entire performance unfolds in one location in real time, without scene edits.

5. **Narrative Long-Form**: This format endeavours to improvise a complete "play", frequently in a specific genre, comprising plot, characters, and thematic development.

And many more. Like Harold, each of these structures boasts unique elements, with different groups often developing their own variations on each format. 

The "Harold" is a format typically used in improv theatre, rather than in pre-written film or television scripts. Improv is a form of live theatre in which the plot, characters, and dialogue of a game, scene, or story are made up in the moment.

The structures listed in the previous response are generally used for scripted works - movies, TV shows, and plays that have been pre-written. While a Harold could potentially be adapted for a scripted format, it's fundamentally designed for improv. (Example: Seinfeld)

Harold's unique structure of opening, beats, group games, and closing allows for spontaneity and immediate audience interaction, which are cornerstones of improv. The flexibility and in-the-moment creativity fostered by the Harold structure make it less suitable for scripted media, where dialogue and scenes are usually carefully crafted and rehearsed ahead of time. 

## Film and Television Structures

Film and television storytelling employ a host of different structures:

1. **Three-Act Structure**: The conventional format divides a screenplay into Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution.

2. **Five-Act Structure**: Traditionally used in plays, the five acts encompass Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Denouement.

3. **Seven-Act Structure**: Often utilized for television dramas, it can pace out the story to suit commercial breaks.

4. **Hero's Journey**: This twelve-stage structure draws inspiration from Joseph Campbell's work and is used in adventure, fantasy, and sci-fi films.

5. **Non-linear Structure**: This presents events out of chronological order, with Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" serving as a notable example.

6. **Parallel Structure**: This involves the simultaneous narration of two equally important stories, toggling between the two.

7. **Circular Structure**: In this format, the story concludes where it begins, providing a neat narrative closure.

8. **Framing Structure**: Here, the story is encapsulated within a different narrative that provides context, akin to a story within a story.

9. **Episodic Structure**: Frequently employed in television, each episode tells a discrete story while contributing to a larger narrative arc across the series.

It's worth noting that this list is not exhaustive. Many films and TV shows integrate elements from different structures, creating a composite narrative format. Additionally, structures can significantly vary across cultures and filmmaking styles, attesting to the infinite versatility and adaptability of storytelling. 

In conclusion, whether you are an educator looking for ways to explain the structures of storytelling, a student studying the art and science of narrative, or a hobbyist interested in the ways stories are told across different media, understanding the formats and structures of storytelling can provide valuable insights. The myriad formats, from the stage to the screen, from written prose to improv theatre, contribute to the richness of narrative traditions. As we continue to create and consume stories, these structures serve as guideposts, helping us navigate the boundless landscapes of human imagination.
