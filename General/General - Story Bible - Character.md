# Story Bible - Character

When creating a story Bible, characters are indeed a crucial element to include. Here are some key aspects to consider when developing and documenting your characters:

* **Character Profiles**: Create detailed profiles for each main character, including their names, ages, physical descriptions, backgrounds, personalities, and motivations. Note their roles in the story and their relationships with other characters.

* **Backstories**: Provide backstories for your characters, outlining their personal histories, experiences, and any significant events that have shaped them. Consider their childhood, family dynamics, education, and past achievements or failures.

* **Goals and Motivations**: Clearly define the goals and motivations driving each character. What do they desire? What are their dreams, fears, and ambitions? understanding these aspects will help you write more authentic and consistent character arcs.

* **Character Arcs**: Plan out the development and growth of your characters throughout the story. Consider how their experiences and interactions will shape their personalities and beliefs over time. A character arc typically involves a transformation or change in attitude or behavior.

* **Relationships**: Map out the relationships between your characters. Identify their allies, enemies, friends, and romantic interests. Note any conflicts or tensions that arise within these relationships and how they may evolve throughout the story.

* **Internal and External Conflict**: Determine the internal and external conflicts each character faces. Internal conflicts refer to emotional or psychological struggles, while external conflicts involve obstacles and challenges from the outside world. Understand how these conflicts drive the characters' actions and decisions.

* **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Define the strengths, skills, and unique qualities of each character. Also, identify their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. These attributes will shape how characters contribute to the plot and interact with one another.

* **Character Arc Consistency**: Ensure consistency in the portrayal of your characters' personalities, traits, and behaviors. Make sure their actions and decisions align with their established profiles and character arcs.

* **Supporting Characters**: Develop supporting characters that complement the main characters and contribute to the story. Although they may have less detailed profiles, they should still have clear roles, motivations, and relationships.

* **Character Relationships with Setting**: Consider how your characters interact with the story's setting. How does their environment influence their actions, values, or beliefs? Ensure that the characters are grounded in their world and respond to it accordingly.

Remember, a story Bible is a reference guide that helps maintain consistency and coherence throughout the narrative. Building well-rounded, relatable, and consistent characters is essential for engaging storytelling.
