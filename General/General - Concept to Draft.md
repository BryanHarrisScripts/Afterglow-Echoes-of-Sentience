# Screenplay Development: From Concept to Final Draft

The order of writing a screenplay often follows these steps:

1. **Concept/Idea**: This is the genesis of the screenplay where you come up with the original idea or concept for the story.

2. **Research**: If your screenplay requires it, you might do some initial research about your subject matter.

3. **Logline**: Write a one to two sentence summary of your story that encapsulates the main conflict and the character's journey.

4. **Beat Sheet**: A beat sheet is a bullet-point breakdown of events in your story. It's a roadmap that outlines your plot point by point.

5. **Outline**: An outline is a more detailed version of a beat sheet, including scene breakdowns, character arcs, and sometimes dialogue. 

6. **Treatment**: A treatment is a narrative version of your story, written in the present tense. It can vary in length from a couple of pages to more than thirty. It's essentially a short story version of your screenplay.

7. **Scene Structure**: At this stage, you'd break down each scene in your screenplay, including setting, characters, conflict, and what each scene accomplishes in terms of plot and character development.

8. **First Draft**: Using your scene structures, treatment, and outline, you write the first draft of your screenplay.

9. **Revision**: Once the first draft is complete, you'll revise, often going through multiple drafts until the screenplay is as good as it can be.

10. **Polishing**: Finally, you'll proofread and polish your script, checking for typos, formatting issues, and making sure everything is as perfect as possible.
