## 1 MILLION CREATORS, COLLABORATORS, VOICES

### An Open Source Experiment

### Introduction

In a world driven by innovation, the boundaries of creativity are continually expanding. The convergence of technology and artistry gives birth to new ways of thinking, creating, and sharing. This experiment is more than a novel approach to managing intellectual property (IP); it's a blueprint for anyone seeking to navigate the complexities of the digital age.

The experiment's multifaceted objective encompasses not only artistic innovation but a reimagining of monetization. It's about building a brand around a screenplay called "Afterglow," connecting with one million followers, activating ad revenue, and attempting to bring the story to life as a movie. But it goes beyond that. The goal is to utilize new ways to monetize, through the gig economy, ad revenues, and creator economy, even leveraging cryptocurrency and smart contracts. This is a living example that anticipates and adapts to future monetization changes in the world.

By intertwining AI, blockchain, smart contracts, and open-source principles into a 4th wave industrial evolution, this approach forges a community that fosters collaboration and showcases how AI is revolutionizing creativity. It's an invitation for writers, developers, artists, hobbyists, students, and anyone intrigued by innovation to participate, innovate, and explore. Through platforms like GitHub for revision control and exclusive posting on social media platform X, the core values of Storytelling Excellence, Creativity and Innovation, Integrity and Ethical Practice, Collaboration and Teamwork, Respect for Artistic Vision, Audience Engagement, and Sustainability are embraced. Technology here opens new paths, not replaces traditional methods.

The application of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0) license to an open-source screenplay fosters global access and collaboration while ensuring recognition of the original work. Together, we're setting the stage for how AI scripts can translate to video and television, reducing costs and time. The acceleration of AI graphics in videos is merely one facet of this groundbreaking innovation.

This is not just an experiment. It's a model, a guide, and an inspiration, laying down a path for creativity in the new world - a path that anyone can follow.

It's a more permissive way of sharing creative works.

In most professional screenwriting contexts, the traditional copyright model would be more common, while the open-source model would be more aligned with collaborative or community-driven projects. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts based on the creator's intent and the nature of the project.
