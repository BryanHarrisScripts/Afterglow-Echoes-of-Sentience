# Your Role And Key Questions 

Greetings, fellow creators!

I'm thrilled to welcome you to Afterglow, a unique open-source storytelling project. As a solo endeavor, your insights and creative sparks play an invaluable role in bringing the narrative to life. Let's shed some light on how you can contribute and what to expect throughout this collaborative process.

### Blocks and Acts
Within each act of Afterglow, you'll find 'blocks' - important narrative milestones akin to book chapters. These blocks are accessible via our GitHub page. Feel free to explore, consider the guiding questions, and share your unique insights directly on the platform.

### The Process Post-Submission
As the sole manager of Afterglow, every piece of your feedback goes through me. I personally review each contribution, assessing its alignment with the story's overall direction. Though this might mean a slower response time, please rest assured your input is never overlooked.

### Feedback and Communication
There may be instances where some suggestions won't find a place in the current narrative. In these cases, I'll do my best to provide constructive feedback and explain the decisions made. I believe in maintaining an open, honest dialogue with all contributors.

### Unlimited Contributions
Feel free to contribute to any number of blocks in any order. Whether you're deep-diving into one block at a time or juggling multiple, it's entirely up to you!

### Embracing the Creative Commons 
Remember, as an open-source project, Afterglow grants you the freedom to adapt and build upon the narrative, creating your own version of the story. All we ask is that you adhere to the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) agreement, ensuring the spirit of collaborative storytelling thrives.

Screenwriters typically have traditional copyrights for their works, which means they reserve all rights to the content they have created. This allows them to control how the work is used, distributed, and modified, often through legal agreements with studios and producers.

Open Source licensing, such as the Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0), is different. This type of license allows others to share, modify, and even build upon the work, provided they give proper attribution to the original author and license their new creations under the identical terms. It's a more permissive way of sharing creative works.

In most professional screenwriting contexts, the traditional copyright model would be more common, while the open-source model would be more aligned with collaborative or community-driven projects. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts based on the creator's intent and the nature of the project.

### Evolving Together 
Should the day come when a million brilliant minds converge on Afterglow (a problem I'd be thrilled to have!), the process will certainly need revisiting. However, without immediate resources for scaling, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's focus on weaving our narrative tapestry together.

Thank you for joining me on this creative journey. Your imagination, collaboration, and patience truly make Afterglow glow. Together, let's craft a narrative that's as luminous and inspiring as its name suggests. 

# Key Questions To Consider

In storytelling, the four-act structure serves as a blueprint, guiding us through distinct narrative phases. For Afterglow, these acts are subdivided into sections known as 'blocks'. As a contributor, it's crucial to understand the purpose of each act to shape and enhance the story effectively. Here are some key questions you might want to consider for each act:

**Act 1: Setup**
The first act introduces us to the world and characters. In this act, ask yourself:
1. "Do the characters' introductions set the right tone for the narrative?"
2. "Are the characters compelling and believable?"
3. "Does the initial setting effectively immerse the reader in the story's world?"
4. "Are there hints at the conflicts or challenges the characters might face?"
5. "Does the end of Act 1 incite curiosity and anticipation for what's to come?"
6. "Does the act, overall, provide a solid foundation for the story?"

**Act 2: Confrontation**
Act 2 sees our characters responding to the 'Call to Adventure'. Key questions include:
1. "How effective is the 'Call to Adventure'?"
2. "Are the characters' reactions to the call believable and in line with their introduced personas?"
3. "Do the challenges introduced evoke suspense and excitement?"
4. "Is there a noticeable escalation in the story's stakes?"
5. "Do the complications introduced thicken the plot and deepen character development?"
6. "Does Act 2 end with a strong midpoint that further complicates matters?"

**Act 3: Building Action**
This act builds upon the confrontation and develops the plot further. Consider the following:
1. "Is the narrative's pacing consistent and engaging?"
2. "Do the characters evolve with the rising action and conflicts?"
3. "How well does this act present additional twists or complications?"
4. "Do the events and character reactions keep the audience invested?"
5. "Is there a clear build-up to the climax?"
6. "Does Act 3 successfully set up for a satisfying resolution?"

**Act 4: Resolution**
Finally, Act 4 is where we find our climax and resolution. Reflect on these points:
1. "Does the story reach a compelling and satisfying climax?"
2. "Are the primary conflicts and challenges resolved convincingly?"
3. "Do the characters demonstrate growth from their experiences?"
4. "Does the resolution align with the narrative's themes and overall trajectory?"
5. "Are there any loose ends that need tying up?"
6. "Does the story end on a satisfying note, considering its previous developments?"

By considering these questions, you can provide valuable insight to make Afterglow a richer and more engaging narrative experience.
