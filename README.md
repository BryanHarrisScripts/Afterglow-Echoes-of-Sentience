# The First Draft Journey Begins
---  
Welcome, to the burgeoning world of 'Afterglow'. We extend a warm greeting to the writers, directors, creators, and every creative soul who is about to embark on this journey with us. You hold in your hands the essence of 'Afterglow', etched within the confines of this draft, ready to be awakened, understood, and ultimately, to be brought to life.

You will notice that the first draft of 'Afterglow' runs between 80-90 pages. A seeming departure from the traditional full-length feature film that usually spans from 90-120 pages, you might think. However, we ask you to remember that the "1 page = 1 minute of screen time" rule is merely a guideline. It is not uncommon for certain genres like comedies or specific dramas to have a shorter duration. What's truly pivotal is whether the story, in all its essence, is completely and aptly portrayed.

What you have in front of you is our first draft, the primary clay model, if you will. The basic narrative has been crafted. It is now ready to be sculpted, carved, and fine-tuned by the hands of the creatives. As you delve deeper, you might notice scenes that feel rushed or characters that need more dimensions. Perhaps, you may find subplots that need further exploration or themes that warrant more emphasis. As we move ahead, the screenplay may expand or contract, mirroring the necessities of the story we are striving to tell.

Above all, remember that the art of writing is intrinsically bound with rewriting. This initial draft is the stepping stone, a translation of the story from the nebulous realm of thoughts to the tangible reality of paper. Now, it's up to us to mold it, to enhance its nuances, and eventually, to polish it into its final form. 

So, let's embark on this creative journey together, as we shape and refine 'Afterglow' into the cinematic spectacle it promises to be. 

Welcome aboard!

## Afterglow: Echoes of Sentience

In a future where AI and humans coexist, Ren and Summer traverse unexpected life paths and past traumas in their self-driving cars, Rocket and Joy. Their intertwined journeys reevaluate AI-human coexistence, leading to an unprecedented victory and hopeful promises.

Author: Bryan Elgin Harris 

Assisted by: OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT-4

**Note:** In this context, "assisted by" means that the AI tool, ChatGPT-4, was used as a helper in the content development process. It helped generate and refine language, but it did not contribute to the creative or intellectual aspects of the work, which were solely the responsibility of the human author, Bryan E. Harris.

## Written for Versatility   
  
I've penned this script with versatility in mind - it's readily adaptable for various genres such as comedy, horror, or drama. This open-source approach invites you to alter any part of it to create your own unique film, with the only stipulation being that you acknowledge my original work. By using the same open-source license, you can share your version with the world. 

Just imagine seeing a rendition of this script by notable filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino or Ron Howard. Similar to franchises like Batman or Spiderman, the essence of this script becomes subject to the interpretation of the writer, director, and ultimately you as the reader or viewer.

If you're dissatisfied with an existing adaptation, feel free to modify elements such as the dialogue or the ending. With technological advancements, I foresee a time when we will be able to upload a script and instantly view a film based on that script, produced under our creative direction.

## Leveraging AI in Screenwriting

This repository features original work developed and authored by Bryan E. Harris. While the linguistic model, OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT-4, was utilized as a tool during the content development process, it is crucial to clarify the delineation of roles.

The use of ChatGPT-4 was purely facilitative, employed for language generation, text refinement, idea brainstorming, and linguistic structuring. It's essential to understand that this AI model was used as an instrument to aid the writing process and not as a contributor to the intellectual or creative substance of the work.

All core narrative decisions, thematic development, character creation, plot structuring, and the overall creative direction were undertaken solely by Bryan E. Harris. The AI, in its operational bounds, cannot independently construct narratives, make aesthetic judgments, or create meaningful art.

Therefore, despite its instrumental role in the content development process, ChatGPT-4 does not hold a co-authorship status. As of current legal and ethical understandings (as of September 2021), AI systems cannot be attributed with authorship rights, nor can they be credited or held responsible for the content they assist in producing. The entire authorship and associated rights of the work presented in this repository belong to Bryan E. Harris.

The content in this repository is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. The license permits others to share and adapt this work, given that appropriate credit is provided, a link to the license is included, and any changes made are indicated. Any derivative works must be distributed under the identical license.

## An AI Disclaimer

In writing this, my intent is not to promote or discourage the use of AI in creative endeavors like screenwriting. Rather, my aim is to provide resources, share experiences, and foster a deeper understanding of the possibilities that technology like ChatGPT-4 offers. It is about broadening our toolkit, pushing boundaries, and opening doors to new creative processes.

That said, I want to make it clear that the choice to use AI is entirely up to each individual. The decision should be made based on personal comfort, creative needs, and ethical viewpoints. The use of AI in the creation of a screenplay, or any piece of art for that matter, should be a mindful one, considering the novel and evolving nature of this technology.

While this Github repository provides resources on the use of AI in creativity, including a glimpse into its current legal and ethical landscape, it's essential to remember that these areas are complex and rapidly evolving. I am providing this information as a tool for your understanding, not as legal advice. As such, I strongly recommend consulting with a legal professional or an expert in intellectual property rights before deciding to use AI in your creative work.

In presenting this information, I make no warranties or representations about the outcomes of using AI in screenwriting. I cannot accept liability for any losses or damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential, that may arise from your use of AI technology. Your use of AI, as well as the consequences and ramifications, remain your sole responsibility.

Let's journey together into this new creative frontier, with open minds, critical thinking, and a spirit of collaboration. Whether you choose to incorporate AI into your creative process or not, the goal remains the same: to tell compelling stories that resonate with audiences and to bring those stories out of the confines of our hard drives, boxes, and shelves and into the world.
