# Welcome to the 'Afterglow' Journey

**Author**: Bryan Elgin Harris  
**Assisted by**: OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT-4

Hello, fellow creators! Welcome to 'Afterglow'. Whether you're a screenwriter, an educator, a student, a hobbyist, or just a curious soul, you're in the right place. I'm Bryan Harris, an independent writer with a background in film studies. This space is an open-source repository for screenwriters. It's a place where we can collaborate, share ideas, and transform a passion for writing into captivating stories. 

## About 'Afterglow: Echoes of Sentience'

Set in a future where AI and humans coexist, 'Afterglow: Echoes of Sentience' explores the intertwined journeys of Ren and Summer. As they traverse their life paths and past traumas in self-driving cars Rocket and Joy, they evaluate AI-human coexistence, culminating in an unprecedented victory and hopeful promises.

The script is adaptable to various genres such as comedy, horror, or drama. You're free to transform any part of it to create your unique film - just remember to acknowledge the original work. By using the same open-source license, you can share your version with the world.

## AI in Screenwriting: A New Tool, Not a Co-Author

The ChatGPT-4 language model was used as a tool during the development process of 'Afterglow'. Its function was to assist in language generation, text refinement, and idea brainstorming. However, all creative aspects, including core narrative decisions, thematic development, character creation, and plot structuring, were handled solely by me. 

AI's role in the process was purely facilitative. As per current legal and ethical considerations (as of September 2021), AI systems cannot be attributed with authorship rights, nor can they be credited or held accountable for the content they assist in producing.

## AI in Creativity: A Disclaimer

This space is for exploring the use of AI in creativity and sharing resources and experiences. Whether you choose to incorporate AI into your creative process is entirely your decision. Consider your personal comfort, creative needs, and ethical viewpoints. As this field is novel and constantly evolving, legal consultation or intellectual property rights expertise may be required.

**Note**: The outcomes of using AI in screenwriting are not guaranteed. Any losses or damages incurred due to your use of AI technology are your responsibility.

Join me as we journey into this new creative frontier, with open minds, critical thinking, and a spirit of collaboration. Let's tell compelling stories and bring them to life, with or without the aid of AI.

Welcome aboard the 'Afterglow' journey!
