# Mastering Markdown for GitHub

### A Screenwriter's Guide

In the realm of collaborative screenwriting, learning to navigate GitHub and its formatting tool, Markdown, can give you a significant edge. Markdown, a simple yet potent text formatting syntax, simplifies the process of writing, editing, and collaborating on GitHub. In this guide, we aim to cover the basics of Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), providing examples of how to format text, create lists, add links, and more.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that adds formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Developed by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, it allows writers to apply formatting to text using a range of simple characters like #, *, and -.

### The Basics of Markdown

Markdown's key strength lies in its simplicity. Here's a look at some basic syntax:

1. **Headers**: Add from one to six # symbols before your heading text. The more symbols, the smaller the heading. For instance, '# The largest heading' generates an h1 heading, '###### The smallest heading' creates an h6.

2. **Emphasis**: Use asterisks (*) or underscores (_) to create italic or bold text. Single for italics '*This text will be italic*', double for bold '**This text will be bold**'.

3. **Lists**: Create unordered lists using the hyphen (-) or asterisk (*) as bullet points. Ordered lists can be made by numbering your items '- Item 1 - Item 2 - Item 3' or '1. Item 1 2. Item 2 3. Item 3'.

4. **Links**: Form a link by enclosing your link text in square brackets ([]), then the URL in parentheses (()), like this: '[GitHub](http://github.com)'.

5. **Images**: To add images, use the same syntax as for links, but add an exclamation mark (!) before the square brackets.

6. **Blockquotes**: Quote a piece of text by using the > character before the text you want to quote: '> This is a quote.'

### GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)

In addition to standard Markdown, GitHub supports its own version, known as GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). GFM offers a range of useful features for the collaborative writer:

1. **Username Mentions**: Tag someone in a discussion or draw their attention to a specific part of your work using '@' followed by their GitHub username. '@username Great work on this scene, but I think it could use a bit more suspense.'

2. **Task Lists**: Track progress by creating task lists. Create a task using '-' followed by a space, then square brackets with a space in between, followed by the task. To mark a task as complete, add an 'x' in between the brackets. '- [ ] Write Act 1' or '- [x] Write Act 1'

3. **Fenced Code Blocks**: Although not typically used in screenwriting, you could use fenced code blocks when discussing technical elements in your screenplay or project's documentation. Create a fenced code block by wrapping your code in triple backticks (`).

4. **Tables**: Make tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |. 'Character | Dialogue --- | --- John Doe | "Hello, world!"'

5. **Strikethrough**: Cross out a word by wrapping it with two tildes ~~. '~~Mistaken text.~~'

To use GFM, simply write in Markdown as you normally would in your .md or .markdown file and upload it to GitHub. The platform will automatically recognize and apply the GFM formatting.

### Making the Most of Markdown and GFM on GitHub

As a screenwriter, using Markdown and GFM on GitHub can add efficiency and organization to your writing process. You can use these tools to structure your scripts, discuss revisions, track your writing progress, and collaborate more effectively with others.

For instance, with task lists, you can break down your writing process into manageable tasks and keep track of what you have completed and what's left to do. With username mentions, you can request input from your collaborators, alerting them to the specific sections you want them to review. Tables can come in handy for organizing your characters' dialogues or tracking the narrative arc of your screenplay. Fenced code blocks, while more relevant to coding, can be used creatively in your screenwriting projects, perhaps to separate different sections or to present an alternate formatting.

### Wrapping Up

As you step into the world of collaborative screenwriting on GitHub, mastering Markdown and GFM can provide you with a valuable skill set. While it may seem challenging at first, over time you will find these tools to be straightforward and highly beneficial to your writing process. They not only bring structure and readability to your scripts but also open up avenues for seamless collaboration and creative discussions. So embrace the power of Markdown and GFM, and let your scripts tell compelling stories in a space that fosters collaborative creativity.
