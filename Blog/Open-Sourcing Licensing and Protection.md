# Licensing and Protection

While the concept of open-sourcing your screenplay may seem like you're giving away your work for free, it's important to understand the nuances of open-source licensing. GitHub provides a platform for establishing an open-source license, which helps set the terms on how others can use, modify, or distribute your work.

The most common open-source licenses ensure that the original creator's work is recognized, even when it's modified or improved by others. By open-sourcing under a proper license, you can ensure that you retain control over your intellectual property, even while benefiting from the collaboration and innovation that open sourcing provides. This gives you the peace of mind to share your work with the world, without worrying about losing credit or control over your creation.

### Creative Commons

One popular open-source licensing choice for creative work is Creative Commons. Creative Commons licenses are flexible and versatile, allowing you to specify the terms of use for your screenplay. For instance, you can choose a license that allows others to modify your work, but only if they give you credit and use their derived works non-commercially. You can even specify that any derivatives must be shared under the same license, further ensuring the open nature of your work.

### GPL for Creative Work

Another choice, albeit a less traditional one, is the General Public License (GPL). Originally designed for software, GPL can be used for any kind of work and guarantees that derivatives of your work must also be open-sourced. This could be an interesting choice if you want to ensure the open-source spirit is maintained in all subsequent adaptations of your screenplay.

### Attribution and Recognition

Regardless of the type of license you choose, the common factor is attribution. When your work is used or modified, you will always be credited as the original author. This allows you to share your work with a wide audience and gain recognition in the industry, even when others contribute to or adapt your work.

### Conclusion

The world of screenplay writing is ripe for innovation. By open-sourcing your screenplay and using platforms like GitHub, you can become a part of this revolutionary shift towards greater collaboration, inclusivity, and creativity in storytelling. Open-source licensing protects your rights as an author while allowing you to benefit from the collective wisdom and talent of the global writing community. It's a brave new world out there for screenwriters, and we're excited to see the amazing stories that will come from this open-source revolution in screenwriting.
