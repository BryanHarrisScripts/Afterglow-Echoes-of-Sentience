# An Experiment in Collaboration: 
### Merging Final Draft, Text Files, and GitHub

The art of screenwriting often thrives on collaboration. Yet, in this digital age, facilitating a seamless, efficient process for joint script development can be a daunting task. Tools like Final Draft dominate the market, providing excellent scriptwriting environments. On the other hand, platforms like GitHub offer robust version control and collaboration options. The question is - can we bring them together?

Let's embark on an experimental journey to try and marry Final Draft with GitHub using intermediary text file formats. Given the differences in these tools, there will inevitably be workarounds and compromises. Still, the potential for streamlined, trackable collaboration is enticing. 

Let's look at the possibilities:

### 1. Exporting Scripts as Plain Text Files

The simplest method is to export your Final Draft script as a plain text file (.txt) and upload it to GitHub. 

- Write your script in Final Draft.
- Export your script from Final Draft as a plain text file (.txt).
- Upload your plain text file to GitHub.
- Collaborators can download the .txt file, make changes, and submit revisions.

Though simple, the drawback is formatting loss in the conversion process. The plain text file will strip out special scriptwriting formatting which may affect the readability of your script.

### 2. Utilizing Avid or Tab Delimited Dialogue Formats

An upgrade on the plain text option is to use the Avid script-based editing or tab delimited dialogue formats. Both formats will preserve some element of the script layout and formatting.

- Write your script in Final Draft.
- Export your script as either Avid or tab delimited dialogue format (.txt).
- Upload this text file to GitHub.
- Collaborators can download the file, make changes, and submit revisions.

While this method retains more formatting, it may still lose some of Final Draft's features and require some manual adjustment.

### 3. Using WriterDuet to Convert .fdx to .fountain

Another route is to use another scriptwriting tool that supports both Final Draft (.fdx) and Fountain (.fountain) formats. WriterDuet is an example.

- Write your script in Final Draft.
- Export your script from Final Draft as an .fdx file.
- Open WriterDuet and import your .fdx file.
- Export your script from WriterDuet to .fountain.
- Upload the .fountain file to GitHub.
- Collaborators can download the .fountain file, make changes, and submit revisions.

Though slightly complex, this method makes use of Fountain's compatibility with GitHub and retains much of Final Draft's rich formatting.

### 4. Using Final Draft's Script Reports Feature

Final Draft has a reports option that allows you to create a script report and export it as a text file. Although it might not follow strict Fountain syntax, it's an option worth exploring.

- Write your script in Final Draft.
- Use Final Draft's reports feature to create a script report.
- Export the script report as a text file.
- Upload this text file to GitHub.
- Collaborators can download the file, make changes, and submit revisions.

This workaround might generate a text file that somewhat resembles the Fountain format. However, compatibility with other software that supports Fountain should be tested.

### Summary

Given these options, it appears the WriterDuet method may be the most effective at preserving formatting and ensuring compatibility with GitHub. It leverages Fountain, the preferred text format for GitHub, which is designed specifically for screenplays. However, it does require using an additional software and a few more steps than other methods.

Remember, this is an experiment, a journey where we're learning as we go. The workarounds might be intricate, and there might be some bumps along the road. But the potential reward is a collaborative, efficient, and transparent scriptwriting process that allows us to focus more on the art of storytelling and less on the logistics of collaboration. 

After careful consideration, we recommend the method involving WriterDuet as potentially the most effective for preserving the integrity of the script while maintaining collaborative functionality. However, the best method will always be the one that suits your specific needs and circumstances.

- Are you focused on preserving as much formatting as possible? Utilize WriterDuet to convert your script to .fountain format.
- Do you prefer to keep it simple and minimize software usage? Exporting as a plain text or Avid/tab delimited dialogue might work better.
- Want to explore Final Draft's full features? Try using the script reports function.

There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, and that's okay. The goal is to find a balance between preserving the formatting and nuances of your screenplay and facilitating a smooth collaboration process.

The script is set, the characters are ready - let's start this adventure together. As we experiment, we look forward to hearing your experiences and insights. After all, collaboration extends beyond the script - it's integral to our creative community.

Happy writing and collaborating!
