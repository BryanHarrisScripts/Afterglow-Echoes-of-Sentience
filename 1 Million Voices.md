### An Open Source Experiment 

### Introduction

This experiment seeks to explore an innovative and potentially powerful strategy for managing intellectual property (IP) in the digital age - particularly for IPs like screenplays. By applying an open-source licensing model, it's possible to foster collaborative creativity while preserving the recognition of the original author. Although this approach presents unique challenges, it also opens up opportunities for a vibrant, shared creative space. 

The experiment will apply the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0) license to an open-source screenplay. This licensing model facilitates global access, extensive collaborations, and ensures recognition of the original work.

### The Goal

The overarching aim is to gather a community of 1 million followers around the project. The underlying assumption here is that if the project can attract a significant following, it can help not just in promoting the original work, but also to provide a framework and a method to grow and impact a vast audience. The process of garnering this following will entail reaching out, connecting, collaborating, and creating together.

### The Process

1. **Release the Work Under an Open-Source License:** The first step involves releasing a screenplay under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license, which fosters creativity and collaboration, ensuring the author's recognition and continued sharing and collaboration through all versions of the work.

2. **Build an Online Presence:** This involves creating a strong online presence where the project can live, grow, and thrive. The presence should ideally be on a platform that encourages creativity, collaboration, and community-building.

3. **Promote and Connect:** Through strategic and consistent promotions, reach out to potential collaborators, contributors, and followers. Engagement is critical here - acknowledging contributions, initiating discussions, and creating an inclusive, welcoming space for everyone.

4. **Foster Collaboration:** Encourage remixes, adaptations, and transformative works. The more creativity the project fosters, the more followers it can attract.

5. **Monitor and Adapt:** Continually assess the growth and impact of the project, adapting strategies as necessary based on the feedback and trends.

### The Impact

If successful, this experiment could demonstrate a potential method for managing and promoting creative work in the digital age. It could provide a blueprint for artists to grow their audience, impact a broad community, and foster collaborative creativity.

This project is about more than just amassing followers; it's about building a community around a shared creative endeavor. The larger the community, the greater the collective creativity, the more significant the impact.

While the experiment focuses on a screenplay, the principles and strategies can apply to any creative work, from novels and music to art and digital media. It's an exploration of new ways of creating and sharing in a digitally connected world, and a demonstration of the potential power of open-source principles in creative fields.

### Disclaimer

This experiment is hypothetical and theoretical. It's an exploration of possibilities and doesn't guarantee success. It's essential to bear in mind that open-source licensing has both benefits and potential pitfalls, and it's crucial to consult with a legal professional before deciding to adopt an open-source model for managing creative works.
