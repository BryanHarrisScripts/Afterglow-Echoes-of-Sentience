# The Dialectical Triad in Screenwriting

### Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis

In the world of storytelling, particularly screenwriting, there exists a philosophical principle known as dialectics - a triad consisting of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. This concept has been drawn from the works of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. While Hegel didn't use these terms directly, the idea has been frequently associated with his work. The dialectical model can be incredibly effective for structuring conflict and growth in screenplays.

**The Thesis**

The thesis is the establishment of a particular state or status quo. In screenwriting, this would be the initial condition of your protagonist and their world. The thesis is the "normal" or "unchallenged" reality that the characters exist in, essentially setting up the starting point of your story. For instance, think of Neo living an ordinary life in "The Matrix" or the world without superheroes in "The Incredibles."

**The Antithesis**

The antithesis is the conflict, the contradiction, or the opposition to the thesis. It introduces an element that challenges the initial state or disrupts the status quo. This can manifest as a new character, an unexpected event, or a revelation. The antithesis is the engine of change and the source of drama. It creates tension and moves the story forward. In "The Matrix," the antithesis is Neo's discovery of the real world behind the simulated reality, while in "The Incredibles," it is the emergence of the supervillain Syndrome.

**The Synthesis**

Finally, the synthesis is the reconciliation of the conflict between the thesis and antithesis. It combines elements of both to create a new reality or state of being. In terms of screenwriting, the synthesis is typically the climax or resolution of the story, where the protagonist overcomes their challenges and a new status quo is established. In "The Matrix," this is Neo embracing his role as 'The One' to defeat the agents, and in "The Incredibles," it is the family learning to work together to defeat Syndrome and accepting their superhero identities.

**Applying the Dialectical Triad in Screenwriting**

Understanding this concept can be very useful in creating a robust narrative for your screenplay. The thesis gives your characters and audience a familiar ground to stand on, the antithesis introduces the necessary conflict and growth catalyst, and the synthesis presents a satisfying conclusion and resolution to the plot and character arcs.

When used effectively, the dialectical triad can help create stories that are dynamic and engaging. It can serve as a basic framework for structuring your screenplay and help you ensure there's adequate conflict and growth throughout the story.

In summary, the dialectical triad of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis can be a very effective tool for shaping and structuring your screenplay. It presents a fundamental model for understanding conflict and character development in storytelling. By incorporating these elements in your screenplay, you can create a compelling narrative that will engage and captivate your audience.
