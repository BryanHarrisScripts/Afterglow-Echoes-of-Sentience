**Block 14 - Therefore, Choices and Adjusted Plan**

4. How does the protagonist adapt to these further complications? 
5. What new decisions do they make in response to these problems, and how do these decisions align with or challenge their character growth so far?
6. How does the protagonist's strategy evolve to accommodate these changes?

**Block 15 - Actions, Major Crisis, and All is Lost**

7. How does the protagonist act in accordance with their updated plan?
8. What major crisis or conflict do they face, and why does this moment feel like an "All is Lost" point for them?

**Block 16 - Dark Night of the Soul, Questions and Revelation**

10. How does the protagonist express their self-doubt, despair, or reflection during this "Dark Night of the Soul"?
11. What questions do they ask themselves about their beliefs, actions, and the possibility of success?

**Block 18 - Action, Climax, and Resolution**
