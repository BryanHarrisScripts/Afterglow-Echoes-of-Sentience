# Character Questions: Act 4

### Navigating the Transformation

In crafting Act 4, it's essential to address your story's resolution and conclude your character's journey. Here are some questions to consider for your story, characters, internal and external influences, theme, and plot:

**Block 19 - Fallout and New Normal**

1. How does your protagonist deal with the immediate aftermath of the climax, both in terms of practical consequences and emotional impact?
2. How has the world of your story changed as a result of the climax? How do these changes establish a "new normal"?

**Block 20 - Remaining Questions and Actions**

3. What questions or unresolved issues remain in your story after the climax?
4. How does your protagonist take action to address these remaining issues?

**Block 21 - Final Choices and Last-Ditch Attempts**

5. What final decisions does your protagonist make, and how do these decisions reflect the growth or changes they've experienced over the course of the story?
6. If there's a final obstacle or surprise, how does this challenge your protagonist? How do they handle this last-ditch attempt?

**Block 22 - Final Actions, Ultimate Stakes, and Climax**

7. How does your protagonist act according to their final decisions? 
8. What are the ultimate stakes revealed in this act? How might they be different from or build upon the climax of Act Three?
9. If there's a secondary climax, how does it relate to your protagonist's internal journey or a subplot?

**Block 23 - Resolution and New Equilibrium**

10. What are the results of your protagonist's final actions? How are the remaining conflicts in your story resolved?
11. How has the status quo changed in the long-term as a result of your story's events?

**Block 24 - Final Reflections and Closing Image**

12. What themes, lessons, or reflections are further explored in the conclusion of your story? How have these been informed by your protagonist's journey?
13. What is the final image or scene of your script, and how does it mirror or contrast with the opening image to emphasize the change over the course of the story?

These questions should help you wrap up your story effectively, offering satisfying resolutions for your characters and conflicts while also reinforcing your story's themes.
