# Character Development Checklist: Act 1 

### Navigating the Transformation 

Here are some questions that a writer might consider for each of these beats:

**Block 1 - Hook, Introduction, and Catalyst**

1. Hook: What unique, compelling scene or idea will immediately draw the audience in?
2. Introduction: Who is the protagonist, what is their ordinary world like, and what key relationships or dynamics define their life?
3. Catalyst (Inciting Incident): What event significantly disrupts the protagonist's life and propels the story into motion?

**Block 2 - Problem, Stakes, and Philosophical Conflict**

4. Problem: What is the major problem or challenge that arises from the Catalyst, and how does it impact the protagonist?
5. Stakes: What does the protagonist stand to lose if they do not solve this problem?
6. Philosophical Conflict: What deeper thematic or philosophical questions are raised by this problem? How do they challenge the protagonist's worldview or beliefs?

**Block 3 - Anti-Theme, Want, and Choice**

7. Anti-Theme: What viewpoint or argument contrasts with the main theme of the story? How is this viewpoint represented or embodied in the story?
8. Want: What does the protagonist desire or aim to achieve in order to solve their problem?
9. Choice: What decision does the protagonist make that propels them into a new, conflict-filled situation?

**Block 4 - Initial Plan, Action, and New Problem**

10. Plan: What initial strategy does the protagonist devise to achieve their goal?
11. Action: What steps does the protagonist take to execute their plan?
12. New Problem: What unexpected obstacles or setbacks arise, complicating the protagonist's situation?

**Block 5 - Adaptation, Revised Plan, and Raised Stakes**

13. Adaptation: How does the protagonist adjust or change their approach in response to the new problem?
14. Revised Plan: How does the protagonist's plan change based on their adaptation?
15. Raised Stakes: How do the potential consequences of failure increase, and how does this heighten the story's tension?

**Block 6 - Choice, Action, and Antagonist Hint**

16. Choice: What crucial decision does the protagonist make in response to the increased stakes?
17. Action: What steps does the protagonist take according to their revised plan, moving the story into Act Two?
18. Antagonist Hint: What hints or introduction are given about the primary antagonist or opposing force? How does this foreshadow the larger conflict to come?

These questions are not exhaustive, and additional questions might arise based on the specifics of the story. They serve as a starting point to ensure key aspects of the story, characters, internal and external influences, theme, and plot are well developed and consistent.
