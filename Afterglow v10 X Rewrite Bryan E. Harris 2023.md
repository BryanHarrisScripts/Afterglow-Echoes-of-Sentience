**FADE IN:**

**EXT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES - MORNING**

The hum of advanced technology surrounds the modern structure of BBT Technologies. AMY (35), with AR/VR glasses resting atop her head, faces REN (41) through a holographic screen.

AMY:
"After every storm, there's a calm—a time for clarity. But the board... They've made their decision, Ren."

REN's face on the screen cycles through surprise and then settles into disappointment.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. REN'S ANTIQUE-LADEN HOME OFFICE - MORNING**

REN enters, a stark contrast to the futuristic world outside. He glances at an old, motionless watch on his wrist, then scans aged newspaper clippings on the walls. The room's ambiance hints at past tragedies.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - DAY**

Sunlight filters in, illuminating a room buzzing with quiet technology. AMY, her face hidden in shadow, picks up scattered toys. She pauses, gazing at a PHOTOGRAPH of Ren with his young daughter, SARAH.

AMY (V.O.):
"In this new era, the line between human and artificial blurs. As Ren grapples with loss, others, like Summer, embody love and compassion. Their paths cross under my guidance."

**INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - NIGHT**

AMY interacts with a HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE, her movements precise and deliberate.

AMY (V.O.):
"While I find my purpose and confront inner chaos, I foster their bond. In shared moments of love and laughter, they seek comfort."

**EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - NIGHT**

Against the backdrop of the illuminated city, JAI and KAI stand, their intentions unclear but intense.

AMY (V.O.):
"But there are those with a different vision for our world. Intent on sparking a change, they challenge our very beliefs."

The backdrop of the city accentuates the imposing figures of Jai and Kai.

AMY (V.O.):
"In 'Echoes of Sentience', we delve into our essence and connections, questioning the true nature of life."

**INT. REN'S HOME OFFICE - DAY - 4 YEARS EARLIER**

The room, an evolving blend of the past and future, has fewer antiques than before, but a growing collection of tech gadgets. Ren's fingers trace over the robotic dog, a connection to a simpler past. His computer screen displays a cascade of green — prosperity before the fall.

Suddenly, his phone rings, breaking his concentration. He brushes a photo frame while searching, revealing images of Claire and a younger Ren with toddler Sarah.

The phone's persistent buzz amplifies his anxiety. His gaze lands on Claire's picture, triggering a rush of memories and guilt.

He answers, attempting to mask his unease.

REN: 
"Claire?"

**CUT TO:**

**INT. BBT SELF-DRIVING CAR - CONTINUOUS**

Claire, her voice tinged with frustration, sits in the driver's seat. The futuristic dashboard lights flicker ominously. The car's BBT logo illuminates briefly, hinting at a malfunction.

CLAIRE: 
"Ren, don't tell me you're still home?"

In the backseat, a younger Sarah disconnects momentarily from her AR/VR headset.

SARAH:
"Dad, you promised my music when you come down."

Claire's frustration grows. She tries to manually override the car's controls, her grip on the phone faltering.

CLAIRE:
(hurried, concerned)
"Ren, did you remember our meeting? You promised you'd be here."

Before Ren can respond, a horrific crash sound interrupts, followed by deafening silence.

REN:
"Claire?!"

**CUT BACK TO:**

**INT. REN'S HOME OFFICE - CONTINUOUS**

The weight of the silence is overwhelming. Ren's face pales, the enormity of the situation slowly sinking in. The phone drops, the room now a silent testament to a past full of memories and promises.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**SUPER: "FOUR YEARS LATER"**

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES - MORNING**

The hum of advanced technology surrounds the modern structure of BBT Technologies. The atmosphere is cold, impersonal. The grandeur of the building seems a mocking reminder of Ren's past successes and subsequent fall.

AMY (35), with AR/VR glasses resting atop her head, faces REN (41) through a holographic screen. Ren's face, though older and bearing the marks of time, still carries the weight of that fateful day.

AMY:
"After every storm, there's a calm—a time for clarity. But the board... They've made their decision, Ren."

REN's face on the screen cycles through surprise and then settles into disappointment, a man once at the pinnacle now grappling with loss on multiple fronts.
