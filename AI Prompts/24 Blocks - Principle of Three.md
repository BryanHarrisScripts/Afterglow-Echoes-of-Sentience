# Principle of Three Prompt

Here are several pages of a screenplay. Please analyze the provided material according to the following criteria:

Does the narrative replace 'and then' with 'therefore' or 'but' between key events to emphasize causation and make the story engaging?
Can you identify instances where the 'Promise, Progress, Payoff' strategy is utilized, reflecting a cycle of expectation and resolution?
Are the events in the story a series of interconnected 'but / because / therefore' moments rather than a collection of random occurrences?
Do the terms 'And,' 'But,' and 'Therefore' serve their intended roles in the narrative structure - 'And' for continuation, 'But' for conflict introduction, and 'Therefore' for progress indication?
Is the prose purposefully structured with each event building upon the previous one, as opposed to being merely decorative?"
