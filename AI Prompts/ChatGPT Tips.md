# ChatGPT Tips

When crafting prompts for ChatGPT, here are some tips to get the most out of your interaction:

1. **Be Explicit**: Clearly state what you want from the model. If you need information, a story, a joke, or any specific response, make sure to specify it in the prompt.

2. **Provide Context**: If your question or request refers to something you've asked before or relies on certain knowledge, be sure to include that context in the prompt. As of its training cutoff in September 2021, GPT-4 doesn't have the capability to remember past interactions or learn new information after the training data.

3. **Use Correct Formatting**: If you want a specific format for the response (like a list or a script), set up your prompt in the same format.

4. **Direct the Tone and Style**: If you want a response in a particular style (like formal or casual) or tone (like funny or serious), make sure to specify this in your prompt.

5. **Control the Length**: If you want a shorter or longer response, you can indicate this in your prompt.

6. **Iterate**: If the model doesnâ€™t give you what you want in the first try, feel free to adjust and refine your prompt, or ask the model to try again.

**Here's an example of a well-constructed prompt**:

"Write a brief, formal introduction to a presentation about the importance of environmental sustainability in urban planning."
As always, the more specific you are with your prompts, the better the results will be.

### Additional:

1. **Guided Conversation**: It's okay to ask one question at a time to guide the conversation. For instance, you could ask "Can I ask you a question?" then wait for the response before proceeding with your main question. This can help when trying to get more specific or complicated information.

2. **Prompt Hierarchy**: If you have multiple queries, order them strategically. Start with general questions and gradually move to more specific ones. This allows the model to better understand the context and provide more accurate responses.

3. **Set Expectations**: If you're looking for creative output like a story or poem, give some guidance on the content you want. For instance, you could specify the genre, character types, or the kind of twist you want in the plot.

4. **Nudge Towards a Different Perspective**: If you're unsatisfied with the answer you've received, try asking the same question but from a different angle or perspective. This will challenge the model to generate diverse responses.

5. **Use Keywords**: Be sure to include important keywords in your prompt. For instance, if you want information about climate change, words like 'global warming', 'carbon emissions', 'greenhouse gases' might help the model understand the context better.

Remember, refining the art of asking the right questions takes practice, so don't be disheartened if you don't get perfect results right away. Keep experimenting with your prompts until you get the response you desire.
