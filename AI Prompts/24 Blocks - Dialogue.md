# Dialogue

**Prompt:**
I've written a draft for a screenplay and I'm looking for advice and suggestions to improve my dialogue. I want to make sure my characters have distinctive voices that reflect their personalities, backgrounds, and relationships. I want the dialogue to advance the plot, reveal character traits, and add tension where needed. I also aim to show, rather than tell, using subtext where appropriate. I want the dialogue to sound natural and be concise and to the point. I also want to avoid unnecessary exposition and create meaningful conflict through dialogue. Could you provide your input and suggestions on how I can improve the dialogue following these guidelines? Here is a portion of my script: 

### Understanding Dialogue
Writing effective dialogue for a screenplay is a skill that often takes time and practice to master. Here are some general tips and strategies to help guide your writing:

1. **Understand Your Characters:** Your characters should have their own distinctive voice. This is built through their background, personality, experiences, and relationships with other characters. Dialogue should reflect these elements. An easygoing surfer will speak differently than a stern military general, for instance.

2. **Advance the Plot:** Dialogue isn't just about filling the silence; it should push the story forward. Each line should have a purpose, such as revealing character traits, adding tension, or moving the plot.

3. **Show, Don't Tell:** Just as in any other form of writing, this principle applies to screenplay dialogue too. Rather than having characters state their feelings or intentions directly, show it through their choice of words, tone, and subtext.

4. **Keep It Brief and to the Point:** Screenplay dialogue needs to be efficient. Unlike a novel, you don't have pages to explain a character's thoughts or feelings. Each line needs to be concise and relevant. 

5. **Use Subtext:** In real life, people often don't say exactly what they mean. They imply, hint, or say one thing while meaning another. In the same way, good dialogue often involves characters talking around the subject, rather than addressing it directly. This can add depth and intrigue.

6. **Make It Natural:** Try to capture the way people actually talk. This means using contractions, interrupting, trailing off, and occasionally using incorrect grammar. Of course, depending on the character or the setting, you might adjust the dialogue to sound more formal or stylized.

7. **Read It Aloud:** This is the best way to know if the dialogue sounds authentic and flows naturally. If it sounds awkward or forced when spoken, it will likely come across the same way on the screen.

8. **Avoid Exposition Dump:** While sometimes necessary, try to avoid having characters spell out backstory or plot details through dialogue. It's often more engaging to reveal these details through action or subtext.

9. **Create Conflict:** Conflict is the engine of any story, and dialogue is a great place to create and escalate it. Characters should have different wants, perspectives, and goals, and these should come into conflict in their dialogue.

10. **Revision is Key:** Rarely will the first draft of your dialogue be the best. Be prepared to rewrite, edit, and refine the dialogue until it feels right.

11. **Research and Observation:** Listening to real-life conversations can provide insight into how people speak and interact, including the rhythms, natural interruptions, and variations in speech. This can also help with creating distinct character voices. Studying film dialogue can be equally illuminating. It's useful to read and watch a diverse range of films to understand different styles and approaches.

12. **Use Dialogue as Characterization:** Dialogue is a powerful tool for characterization. The way a character speaks can tell us a lot about who they are. Their vocabulary, sentence structure, and even the topics they choose to discuss can reveal their education, background, personality, and values.

13. **Balance Dialogue and Action:** While dialogue is important, it shouldn't carry the whole story. Remember that film is a visual medium and make sure to balance dialogue with action. Show us what the characters are doing, not just what they are saying.

14. **Dialogue Tags:** When writing a screenplay, it's common to use minimal dialogue tags (he said, she said). This is because it's usually clear who's speaking based on the screenplay format. If the speaker isn't obvious, it's often better to use an action line to clarify who's speaking rather than adding a tag.

15. **Embrace Silence:** Sometimes, what isn't said can be as important as what is said. Don't be afraid to let your characters be silent, to let their actions and reactions speak for them.

16. **Dialogue Is Not Real Speech:** Despite the advice to make dialogue natural, it's important to remember that dialogue in a screenplay isn't exactly like real-life speech. Real conversations have a lot of filler — ums, ahs, likes, and you knows — that aren't usually included in dialogue (unless it's important for characterizing). Screenplay dialogue is a crafted version of speech.

17. **Conflict and Tension:** Remember, conflict and tension make dialogue interesting. Characters should want different things, have secrets, misunderstand each other, lie, argue, tease, and joke. This helps create dynamic, engaging dialogue. 

18. **Read Professional Screenplays:** This can't be stressed enough. The more screenplays you read, the more you'll get a sense of how professional screenwriters handle dialogue. You'll see how they balance dialogue with action, how they use subtext, and how they reveal character through dialogue.

Remember, there are no hard and fast rules in writing, only guidelines. What's most important is to find your own voice and tell the story you want to tell. The more you write, the better you'll get!

These tips are starting points. You'll find your own style and voice as you practice writing more. It can be helpful to read successful screenplays to see how professional screenwriters handle dialogue. Remember, writing is subjective and there's always room for creativity and experimentation.
