# Elevator Pitch

Hi, I'm Bryan Harris, the screenwriter behind the compelling sci-fi, drama, comedy, and romance movie set in 2030's San Francisco, titled "Afterglow: Echoes of Sentience". This narrative unravels the ideological split within BBT Technologies, a pioneering AI company. Co-founder Ren champions AI as a tool for love and connection, but when a deadly exploit by his partners results in the loss of his AI family, his world shatters.

What's even more fascinating is that we leveraged AI technology during the editing process of our script, making the creation of our story as groundbreaking as its narrative. 

The film takes us through Ren's journey of grief and isolation, his subsequent romance with Summer, a lively nature lover, and the unexpected alliances he forms with his AI creations. Culminating in a climactic turn of events, Ren harnesses the power of AI for empathy and redemption, regaining control of the company he helped establish and rectifying the injustices inflicted by his partners.

Simultaneously, we follow Amy, his AI assistant, on her quest to understand human love. The story is sprinkled with the entertaining dynamics of two self-driving cars, Rocket and Joy, who add both humour and depth to the narrative.

"Afterglow: Echoes of Sentience" is a poignant exploration of how AI can reflect and even foster human emotions and personal growth, amidst the backdrop of societal debates on AI ethics. It's a story of technology, love, loss, and redemption, where AI transcends its mechanical nature to mirror human experiences. 

This narrative truly showcases AI, not just as a story element, but as a valuable tool in the storytelling process itself.
