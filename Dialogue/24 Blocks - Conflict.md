# Dialogue and Conflict

Conflict is the engine that drives your story forward. It creates tension, interest, and propels your characters into action. And dialogue is one of the most powerful ways to convey and escalate conflict.

Conflict in dialogue isn't just about shouting matches or arguments (though it can be). It's about any kind of disagreement, big or small, that reveals character and pushes the plot forward. Here are some ways you can use dialogue to create effective conflict:

- **Verbal Sparring**: Characters can have a heated exchange where they challenge each other's beliefs or desires. This can create immediate tension and drama.

- **Subtle Disagreement**: Conflict doesn't always have to be loud. A character can subtly express disagreement or discontent, creating an undercurrent of tension.

- **Hiding the Truth**: If a character is hiding something, their dialogue can create conflict through lies, evasions, or half-truths.

- **Conflicting Goals**: If characters have conflicting goals or desires, their dialogue will reflect that conflict. They might argue about the best course of action or try to persuade each other to change their plans.

Remember, conflict doesn't always mean characters are at each other's throats. It's about the push and pull, the disagreements and differences, that create tension and keep the story moving.
