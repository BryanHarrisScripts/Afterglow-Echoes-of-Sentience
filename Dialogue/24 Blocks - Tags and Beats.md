# Dialogue Tags and Beats

Dialogue tags and action beats are two tools that can aid in making your dialogue more engaging and dynamic. They provide clarity, break up the dialogue, and offer insights into characters' emotions and actions.

- **Dialogue Tags**: These are the "he said" or "she asked" tags that identify the speaker. They should be used judiciouslyâ€”often, a simple "said" is less distracting than more expressive tags like "exclaimed" or "shouted". Remember, you don't always need dialogue tags, especially in a two-person conversation where it's clear who's speaking.

- **Action Beats**: These are the small bits of action interspersed with dialogue. They can serve multiple purposes: break up dialogue, reveal character traits, convey emotion, or control pacing. For instance, a character may tap their fingers while speaking, indicating nervousness.

Here's an example of using both:

> "I don't know about this, John," Sarah said, wringing her hands. "It doesn't feel right."

The dialogue tag ("Sarah said") clarifies the speaker, while the action beat ("wringing her hands") adds emotional context.
