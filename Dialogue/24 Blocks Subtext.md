# Writing Subtext in Dialogue

Subtext is a subtle and potent tool in dialogue writing. It refers to what's being communicated beneath the surface, the unspoken thoughts, feelings, and intentions that are conveyed indirectly. Here are some ways to integrate subtext into your dialogue:

- **Say One Thing, Mean Another**: Characters often don't say what they really think or feel. They might use irony, sarcasm, or implication to express themselves without saying it outright.

- **Hidden Motives**: Characters may have ulterior motives that they hide beneath seemingly innocuous dialogue. The audience may know or suspect what the character is really after, adding tension.

- **Avoidance**: Characters may avoid discussing uncomfortable or painful subjects, instead talking around them or changing the subject. The unsaid words can carry a heavy weight.

- **Nonverbal Communication**: Remember that communication isn't just about words. Characters can convey a lot through body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice.

Subtext can add depth, complexity, and realism to your dialogue. It allows for more nuanced communication and can make your characters feel more multi-dimensional and human.
