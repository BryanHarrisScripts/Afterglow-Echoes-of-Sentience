# Basics of Dialogue Writing

Welcome to the start of our comprehensive guide on dialogue writing. This first post will introduce you to the basics of dialogue writing. Dialogue, the spoken words between characters, is a key aspect of scripts that can breathe life into your characters, propel the plot forward, and immerse your audience in your story.

The core components of effective dialogue include naturalism, subtext, conflict, character voice, and exposition.

* **Naturalism**: The language of your characters should feel natural and believable. Avoid jargon, overly formal language, or anachronisms, unless these serve your characters or story.

* **Subtext**: Subtext is what lies beneath the surface. It's what the characters are thinking but not explicitly stating. It can add depth and complexity to your characters and scenes.

* **Conflict**: Dialogue isn't just idle chat; it's a tool to create and escalate conflict. Whether it's a heated argument or a subtle disagreement, conflict in dialogue propels the story forward and heightens interest.

* **Character Voice**: Each character should have a distinctive voice. The way a character speaks should reflect their personality, background, and beliefs.

* **Exposition**: Dialogue can deliver important information to the audience, but be careful not to make it feel forced or unnatural. "As you know, Bob" moments can pull the audience out of the story.
