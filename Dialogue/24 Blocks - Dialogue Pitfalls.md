# Avoiding Common Dialogue Pitfalls

Dialogue writing can be tricky, and there are common pitfalls that many writers fall into. Identifying these can help you steer clear and improve the quality of your dialogue. Here are some mistakes to avoid:

- **On-The-Nose Dialogue**: Characters say exactly what they feel or think, which often feels unnatural and lacks subtext. Instead, try to convey emotions or intentions indirectly.

- **Unnatural Phrasing**: Dialogue should feel natural and realistic. Be careful with overly formal language, complex sentences, or technical jargon, unless it's appropriate for the character or situation.

- **Info Dump**: Using dialogue to deliver large amounts of information can feel forced and slow the pace. Try to "show" instead of "tell" or sprinkle information throughout the story.

- **Lack of Character Voice**: Every character should have a distinctive voice. If all characters sound the same, they might feel flat and uninteresting.

- **Lack of Conflict**: Dialogue should often serve to create or escalate conflict. If every conversation is friendly and agreeable, the story might lack tension and interest.
