# Creating Distinctive Voices

Giving each character a unique and consistent voice is a vital part of dialogue writing. It makes characters memorable and helps the audience distinguish between characters. Here are some techniques to create distinctive voices:

- **Background**: Consider the character's background. Their upbringing, education, and home region can all affect how they speak. A character from a rural area might speak differently than one from a big city.

- **Personality**: A character's personality should influence their dialogue. Outgoing characters might talk more and use more expressive language, while introverted characters might be more reserved and thoughtful in their speech.

- **Beliefs and Values**: A character's beliefs, values, and motivations can also influence their dialogue. They might frequently reference their values or use language that reinforces their worldview.

- **Verbal Tics**: Characters can also have unique verbal tics or phrases they use often. Just make sure it doesn't become annoying or distracting.

Remember, consistency is key. Once you've established a voice for a character, make sure it stays consistent throughout your script.
