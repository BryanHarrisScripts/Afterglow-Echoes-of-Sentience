# Storyboard:

Based on the script "A Dance with Summer's Intervention," I'll create a shot list capturing key visual elements from at least 5 scenes. This list will help in visualizing the screenplay and guiding the image generation process. 

**Shot List:**

| Scene Description | Shot Type | Notes | Scene Number |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Vibrant summer day in Santa Cruz, AI traffic lights, bots serving in cafes, AI cars and surfers. | Wide shot | Capture the essence of a technologically advanced, lively summer day in Santa Cruz. | 1 |
| Joy parks, robotic dog and other AI animals emerge. Summer orchestrates their movement. | Medium shot | Focus on the interaction between Summer and the AI animals, showing the robotic dog mimicking drinking. | 2 |
| Rocket's sleek exterior gliding through Santa Cruz, parking beside Joy. | Tracking shot | Emphasize the modern and sleek design of Rocket in contrast to the vibrant cityscape. | 3 |
| Ren in the back seat of Rocket, panting and desperate for water. | Close-up | Capture the intensity of Ren's desperation and the interior details of the car. | 4 |
| Ren stumbles out of Rocket, collapsing on the asphalt, Summer offering water. | Wide shot | Show the contrast between Ren's distress and Summer's calm authority, including the surroundings for context. | 5 |

Please confirm if this shot list aligns with your vision for the scenes before we proceed to Step 3, where we'll create images based on this list.
