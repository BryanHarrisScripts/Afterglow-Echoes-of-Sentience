## AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"

### A DANCE WITH SUMMER'S INTERVENTION
**Block 9 - v9**

### SANTA CRUZ

### EXT. SANTA CRUZ - DAY
_A vibrant summer day in Santa Cruz. AI traffic lights direct the flow, bots serve patrons in cafes, and billboards hum with tech ads. AI sports cars and surfers coexist. Laughter and the distant thrill of a rollercoaster fill the air._

### EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

_Joy, parks. A robotic dog springs from the opening doors, tail spinning, scanning. It bounds to a water dish dropped by Summer and mimics drinking._
_From Joy, more AI animals emerge - turtles, a macaw, and Buzz. Summer orchestrates their movement, her eyes mirroring the harmony. She claps with enthusiasm._

**SUMMER:**  
"Be Free!"

### EXT. REN'S ROCKET (SANTA CRUZ MAIN) - DAY

_Rocket glides through Santa Cruz, sleek exterior catching sunlight._

**ROCKET:**  
"Ain't she a beauty?"  

_Parking the car beside Joy._

### INT. REN'S ROCKET (BACK SEAT) - DAY
_Inside, Ren pants, sweat soaking his shirt, a makeshift turban around his head. He whispers a desperate plea for water._

**REN:**  
"Water...Water..."  

_The Falcon Wing doors unfold, akin to mechanical wings preparing for unboarding._

### EXT. ROCKET THE CAR - DAY
_Ren stumbles out of Rocket, overpowered by the heat. He collapses onto the asphalt, gasping, as the car doors snap shut, trapping his messenger bag inside._

### EXT. JOY THE CAR - DAY
_Seeing Ren's condition, Summer fetches her water bottle from Joy. She hands the water to Ren, exuding authority. His trembling hands clutch the bottle._

### EXT. SANTA CRUZ STREET - DAY

_Ren drinks the water Summer offered, desperation driving his urgency._  
_Ren gazes at Summer, sunlit hair haloed against the sky. Her compassionate smile, his beacon._

**SUMMER** _(softly):_  
"Stay with me, okay?"  

_Ren raises his face skyward, welcoming the sudden downpour washing over him. The cool relief floods his senses, replenishing his parched skin. He savors the droplets, his joy evident in his wide smile._  
_Ren smiles at Summer, his savior._

**REN** _(whispered):_  
"An... angel."

**SUMMER:**  
"Just a girl with water, saving strays."  

_Their eyes meet, understanding conveyed without words. A comfortable silence descends, laced with shared comprehension and humor over their unusual circumstance._

**SUMMER:**  
"You're a mess."

**REN:**  
"I've seen better days."  
_She offers a hand._

**SUMMER:**  
"Up you get. Can't have you scaring off the tourists, now can we?"  

_Their laughter fills the air, bonding them. Ren accepts her help, rising beside her, marking the start of their shared journey._

**SUMMER:**  
"I'm Summer, your unofficial guide to surviving Santa Cruz."

**REN:**  
"Ren. Thanks... for everything."

### INT. ROCKET - DAY

**BBT EMPLOYEE:**  
"Mr. Smith. Locks, breaks, windows, AC. All good. Our apologies...hello?"
