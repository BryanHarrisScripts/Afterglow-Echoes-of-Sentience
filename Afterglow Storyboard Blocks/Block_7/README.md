## AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"

## "THE LONG ROAD TO SILENCE"

### Block 7 - v10

#### INT. REN'S CAR - DAY

_Ren's moment of solitude is shattered by the unexpected blare of a pop song, unmistakably Sarah's favourite. Rocket's voice pierces through._

**ROCKET:**  
"Ren! Thought a song might brighten the mood?"

**REN:**  
"Rocket, why that song? Are you glitching?"

**ROCKET:**  
"Unexpected error... It's... Sarah's song, right?"

_Ren's gaze, heavy with memories, is drawn to the rear-view mirror. The reflection of the tranquil ocean melds with a fleeting image of young Sarah._

#### FLASHBACK: INT. REN'S CAR - DAY (PAST)

_Young SARAH, her face radiant with joy, sings in the backseat._

**SARAH:**  
"Dad, our song!"

#### INT. REN'S CAR - DAY (PRESENT)

_Emotion chokes Ren's voice._

**REN:**  
"Sarah..."

_Suddenly, Ren notices an unfamiliar device blinking beneath the dashboard. Retrieving it, he examines it with confusion._

**REN (CONT'D):**  
"Rocket, what is this device?"

**ROCKET:**  
"Experiencing issues, Ren. System offline."

_The car veers dangerously on the cliffside road. The serene ocean below mirrors the tension inside the car._

**REN:**  
"Rocket! Self-diagnostic, now!"

**ROCKET:** 
"Working on it, Ren."

#### INT. SUMMER'S CAR - DAY

_The interior bustles with activity. Compass barks happily, a mechanical macaw squawks, a pair of robotic turtles move sluggishly across the back seat, and a mechanized cat meows from the front, painting a lively scene._

**JOY:**  
"How did it get this bad?"

_An alert grabs Summer's attention._

**SUMMER:**  
"Joy, is that you? What's happening?"

**JOY:**  
"Feeling a tad off today."

#### INT. BIG BEN TECHNOLOGIES - DAY

_Alarms blare._

**BBT TECH SUPPORT:**  
"Mr. Smith, Rocket's showing unusual behavior."

**REN (V.O.):**  
"He's unresponsive. I've found an odd device here."

**BBT TECH SUPPORT:**  
"Hold on. Analyzing... Ms. Ray, we've detected irregularities in Joy's systems."

**SUMMER (V.O.):**  
"But she's functioning normally?"

**BBT TECH SUPPORT (SUMMER):**  
"Appearances can be deceiving. Running diagnostics on both AIs."

**BBT TECH SUPPORT (REN) (CONT'D):**  
"Mr. Smith, Rocket's diagnostic report shows no anomalies. We're trying to triangulate his cloud coordinates now."

#### 14. REN (V.O.)

"Is he lost?"

**BBT TECH SUPPORT:**  
"We're having difficulty locating Rocket in the cloud. However, you're connected to BBT AIME and are completely safe. You can relax, Mr. Smith."

**REN:**  
"Wait, what?"

#### INT. REN'S CAR - DAY

**REN:**  
"Rocket? Respond!"

_Only a recorded BBT TECH SUPPORT voice answers._

**BBT TECH SUPPORT:**  
"Remember, you're in good hands. We're driving the future, together."

_A moment of silence, then ROCKET's systems light up._

**A.I.M.E.:**  
"Diagnostics complete. A.I.M.E. System stable. Thank you for your patience, Ren."

#### INT. SUMMER'S CAR - DAY

**JOY:**  
"Diagnostics clear. All systems normal."

**SUMMER,**  
_(smiling)_  
"That's more like it, Joy."

#### EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

_Rocket and Joy's paths begin to merge, two machines hinting at a future encounter, driving the future together under the golden horizon._
