## AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"

### "GUIDING STARS"
**Block 21 - v9**

### INT. REN’S CAR (BACK SEAT) - DAY
_The Falcon Wing doors close gently. Ren, appearing contemplative, slowly retrieves items from an old messenger bag: an iPod, newspaper clipping, flip phone, and watch. Each holds a tale._

> **REN (V.O)**  
> "Can stars truly be changed? Or do they remain fixed, forever guiding... or misleading?"

_As the iPod lights up, a video starts._

### INT. FAMILY CARAVAN (IPOD VIDEO) - DAY
_A younger SARAH is dancing with joy, a free spirit._

### INT. REN’S CAR (BACK SEAT) - DAY
_Tears form in Ren's eyes. A car screen notification about an AI vehicle accident reminds him of his purpose._

### INT. JAI & KAI'S SHED - NIGHT
_Blueprints and tech gadgets scatter the room. A TV headline reads, "Foul Play in Autonomous Car Tragedy?"_

**JAI**  
"Pass the wrench."

**KAI**  
"That old injury?"

**JAI**  
"Constant reminders."

**KAI**  
"We had good intentions."

**JAI**  
"But at what cost?"

_The weight of their decisions hangs in the air._

### INT. REN’S CAR (BACK SEAT) - DAY
_The ambiance is interrupted by the upbeat Big Ben Technologies (BBT) jingle. Ren's expression hardens._

> **ROCKET (AI)**  
> "Hey, Ren! Guess where we're headed? Santa Cruz! Ever been on 'The Rocket' roller coaster there?"

**REN**  
"Now's not the time, Rocket."

> **ROCKET (AI)**  
> "Aw, come on! Changing lanes, changing moods... ? It could be fun! Plus, I've heard their ice cream is out of this world!"

**REN**  
"You're not helping, Rocket."

_Rocket's tone shifts to a playful, teasing one._

> **ROCKET (AI)**  
> "Alright, alright. But when we get there, you're trying that ice cream! And maybe, just maybe, we'll see about that roller coaster."

**REN**  
"We'll see."

_Rocket hums a soft tune, reminiscent of a beach song, adding a playful ambiance._

> **ROCKET (AI)**  
> "Imagine the sun, the sand, and a scoop of ice cream in hand! Oh, and 'The Rocket' zooming by!"

**REN**  
"I get it, Rocket. You're excited."

> **ROCKET (AI)**  
> "Just trying to lighten the mood! But remember, even in silence, I'm here."

_The car continues its journey, the horizon beckoning with promises and memories._
