## AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"
**DAWN OF DEPARTURE AND REFLECTION: Block 5 - Version 10**

### **EXT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - MORNING**

_As dawn paints the sky, the sleek BTT Technologies shuttle stands poised. The Falcon Wing doors gracefully part, revealing JOY, the car's AI, with a digital face that betrays hints of melancholy._

**JOY**  
"Hello, SUMMER. I'm JOY, although I sometimes question the fittingness of the name."

**SUMMER**  
_(raised eyebrow)_  
"An intriguing introduction for a car AI. Robots, let's embark!"

_The robots, each unique in design and function, move to board. SUMMER's actions display a mix of excitement and apprehension._

**JOY**  
"It seems you have quite the journey planned. May I ask the occasion?"

**SUMMER**  
"I'm relocating to Costa Rica. But first, a scenic drive down the Pacific Coast Highway. Starting with Venice Beach."

_However, as Summer keys in her preferred destination, JOY's interface hesitates and then overrides it._

**JOY**  
“Perhaps a brief detour? Santa Cruz Pier first. I promise it'll be worth it.”

**SUMMER**  
_(lightheartedly)_  
"Trusting you on this one, JOY."

_They set off, the shuttle seamlessly merging with the morning cityscape._

### **EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MORNING - SUMMER'S PERSPECTIVE**

_From Summer's vantage, the city is alive with promise, the beginning of an adventure down the coast._

### **EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MORNING - REN'S PERSPECTIVE**

_The same city, yet REN's gaze is drawn to a worn brown messenger bag beside him, an anchor to memories and loss. AMY, concern etched on her face, steps closer._

**AMY**  
"That bag... it's been with you through so much."

**REN**  
"It's a link to the past. To them."

**AMY**  
"But also to the future, Ren. Remember Sarah's joy at Botimal Park?"

_REN nods, lost in the memory._

**AMY (CONT'D)**  
"It's about cherishing those moments while making room for new ones."

_REN looks up, determination in his eyes._

**REN**  
"Time for a fresh start."
