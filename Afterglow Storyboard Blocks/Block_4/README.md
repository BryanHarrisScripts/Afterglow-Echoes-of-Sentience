## "BROKEN NUMBERS, SHATTERED HEARTS"
Block 4 - v10

### INT. REN'S HOME OFFICE - DAY
_FLASHBACK TO (4 YEARS EARLIER)_

>_The room, an evolving blend of the past and future, has fewer antiques than before, but a growing collection of tech gadgets. Ren's fingers trace over the robotic dog, a connection to a simpler past. His computer screen displays a cascade of green — prosperity before the fall._

>_Suddenly, his phone rings, breaking his concentration. He brushes a photo frame while searching, revealing images of Claire and a younger Ren with toddler Sarah._

>_The phone's persistent buzz amplifies his anxiety. His gaze lands on Claire's picture, triggering a rush of memories and guilt._

>_He answers, attempting to mask his unease._

**REN**
"Claire?"

### CUT TO:

### INT. BBT SELF-DRIVING CAR - CONTINUOUS

>_Claire, her voice tinged with frustration, sits in the driver's seat. The futuristic dashboard lights flicker ominously. The car's BBT logo illuminates briefly, hinting at a malfunction._

**CLAIRE**
"Ren, don't tell me you're still home?"

>_In the backseat, a younger Sarah disconnects momentarily from her AR/VR headset._

**SARAH**
"Dad, you promised my music when you come down."

>_Claire's frustration grows. She tries to manually override the car's controls, her grip on the phone faltering._

**CLAIRE**
(hurried, concerned)
"Ren, did you remember our meeting? You promised you'd be here."

>_Before Ren can respond, a horrific crash sound interrupts, followed by deafening silence._

**REN**
"Claire?!"

### CUT BACK TO:

### INT. REN'S HOME OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

>_The weight of the silence is overwhelming. Ren's face pales, the enormity of the situation slowly sinking in._

>_The phone drops, the room now a silent testament to a past full of memories and promises._

_FADE TO BLACK._

_4 YEARS LATER_

_FADE IN:_

### EXT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES - MORNING

>_The hum of advanced technology surrounds the modern structure of BBT Technologies. The atmosphere is cold, and impersonal. The grandeur of the building seems a mocking reminder of Ren's past successes and subsequent fall._

>_AMY (35), with AR/VR glasses resting atop her head, faces REN (41) through a holographic screen. Ren's face, though older and bearing the marks of time, still carries the weight of that fateful day._

**AMY**
"After every storm, there's a calm—a time for clarity. But the board... They've made their decision, Ren."

>_REN's face on the screen cycles through surprise and then settles into disappointment, a man once at the pinnacle now grappling with loss on multiple fronts._
