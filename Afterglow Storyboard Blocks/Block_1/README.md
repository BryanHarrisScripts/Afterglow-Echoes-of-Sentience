## AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"
### PUPPETS AND PUPPETEERS PART 1: Block 1 - Version 10

### FADE IN:
### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES BOARDROOM - MORNING
_The room, sleek and dominated by chrome and glass, buzzes with muted conversations. At the head of the long table stands AMY, her form strikingly human, yet with a subtle metallic sheen. Her eyes, windows to advanced circuitry, scan the room._

**AMY:**  
"Good morning, everyone. We are here to discuss the future direction of BBT."

_As she speaks, a HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY activates, showcasing early designs of humanoid AIs, with AMY at the forefront._

**AMY (CONT'D)**  
"My creation marked a significant leap for BBT. However, my humanlikeness raised concerns."

### FLASHBACK TO (4 YEARS EARLIER) 

### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES LAB - NIGHT

_REN, deeply engrossed, makes final adjustments to AMY, who lies inert on a table. JAI and KAI enter, their expressions a mix of awe and concern._

**JAI**  
"She's too... human, Ren."

**KAI**  
"People won't accept this. It's too soon."

**REN, DEFIANT:**  
"She's the future."

### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES BOARDROOM - MORNING
**AMY**  
"Jai and Kai's concerns led to modifications in subsequent models. But unbeknownst to them, Ren created two more like meâ€”Claire and Sarah."

_The holographic display shifts, revealing images of CLAIRE and SARAH, their designs closely resembling AMY's._

**AMY (CONT'D)**  
"Today's decision, however, carries weight beyond business strategy. It's a pivotal moment, for me and BBT."

_A door slides open, revealing JAI and KAI. Their expressions are stern, yet there's a hint of apprehension._

**JAI**  
"Ren's vision, while groundbreaking, challenges societal norms. And today, we make a decision that will shape our company's legacy."

**AMY, her voice steady but with an underlying emotion.**  
"I understand the gravity of this moment. Let's proceed."

### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES CORRIDOR - LATER
_JAI and KAI, engaged in a hushed conversation, make their way down the corridor. Their path is lit by ambient blue lights, creating an atmosphere of secrecy._

**KAI (whispering)**  
"The police and military see potential in our humanoid AIs. They're not just tools for society; they could be invaluable for surveillance and defense."

**JAI (nods)**  
"It's a new era, Kai. Our creations could be the bridge between technology and societal safety. But we must tread carefully."

**KAI**  
"We've always believed our actions are for the greater good. But we must be prepared for the challenges ahead."
