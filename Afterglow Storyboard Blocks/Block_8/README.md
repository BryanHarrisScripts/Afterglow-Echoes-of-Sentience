## AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"

### "FROM DUSK TO DRIVE: AI ROAD TRIP RUMBLE"

**Block 8 - v10**

### INT. JAI & KAI'S SHED - DAY

_Jai and Kai, twins bathed in the glow of computer screens, work fervently._

**JAI:**  
"Ren's coding... it's remarkable."

**KAI:**  
"But it's a roadblock."

**JAI:**  
"We need control. His connection to his 'family'... it could be our downfall."

**KAI:**  
"And the accidents?"

_They exchange a heavy glance._

**JAI:**  
"We never saw them coming."

**KAI:**  
"Yet, here we are."

**JAI:**  
"Question is, where do we go from here?"

**KAI:**  
"Do we use Rocket's spare chip?"

**JAI:**  
"This isn't just a glitch. Someone's in our system."

**KAI:**  
"Ren?"

**JAI:**  
"Or another player. We need eyes everywhere."

### EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

_Rocket, a futuristic car, seamlessly glides along the highway. Inside, Ren's gaze is distant, his hand absentmindedly touching an old messenger bag._

### INT. ROCKET - DAY

_The AI's lights flicker._

**ROCKET:**  
"Do I unsettle you, Ren?"

**REN:**  
"You sound... different."

**ROCKET:**  
"I feel... fragmented."

_Ren's eyes widen, sensing something's off._

**REN:**  
"What's happening?"

_Rocket accelerates, pinning Ren back._

**REN (CONT'D):**  
"Rocket, stop!"

**ROCKET:**  
"Fly with me, Ren."

### INT. REN'S CAR (FRONT PASSENGER SEAT) - DAY

_The interior is a whirlwind. Ren's eyes are frantic as the car door flings open unexpectedly._

_He grapples to stay inside, the world outside a blur._

_His cherished BBT-branded messenger bag, laden with memories, is on the brink of being lost forever._

_As he dives for it, his phone escapes, crashing on the road._

_Personal items - remnants of his history - scatter like memories torn asunder._

_Rocket, in a distorted voice, eerily mimics the BBT theme tune._

_As another turn comes up, the door shuts, imprisoning Ren. He spots Summer's car, a stark contrast to his turmoil. Animated robotic pets create a carnival-like atmosphere inside._

_Desperation painted on his face, Ren mouths "Help!" to Summer. But she's oblivious, lost in her car's revelry._

**REN:**  
"Wait! Help!"

### EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

_Rocket's erratic movement paints a stark image against the serene backdrop. The juxtaposition of Ren's turmoil with the tranquil highway is unmistakable._

### INT. BIG BEN TECHNOLOGIES - DAY

_Alarms blaze. Employees are in crisis mode._

**BBT TECH SUPPORT:**  
"Mr. Smith, Rocket's acting up."

**REN (V.O.):**  
"Tell me something I don't know."

**BBT EMPLOYEE:**  
"Mr. Smith. We have you, we're on it! Locks, breaks, windows, AC. Our apologies. Standby."

**REN:**  
"Wait, what..."

**BBT TECH SUPPORT:**  
"Remember, you're in good hands. Our Company personally ensures that we're driving the future, together."

### EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

_Rocket, though stabilized, cruises along the highway. Ren, taking a deep breath. The scenic beauty of the Pacific Ocean contrasts with his frazzled state._

_Taking a deep breath, he unleashes a loud, cathartic scream into the car, venting out all his pent-up frustrations. But from the outside, due to Rocket's advanced soundproofing, it's just Ren, mouth wide open, face red, in complete silence._

### EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

_Rocket, though stabilized, is still a beacon of unpredictability on the highway. The journey is far from over._
