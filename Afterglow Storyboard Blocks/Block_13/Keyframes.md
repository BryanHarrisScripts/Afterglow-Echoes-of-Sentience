### Markdown Table Shot List with Aesthetic Guidelines

To ensure a consistent aesthetic, style, and color palette across all images for "Afterglow," I have incorporated specific guidelines into the shot list. Here's the table with consideration for color palette consistency, lighting and shadow play, cinematic composition, style consistency, texture and detailing, emotional tone, use of technology, and visual effects:

| Scene Description | Shot Type | Notes | Scene Number |
|-------------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| **Beach with bonfire** | Wide shot | Emphasize the blend of cool and warm tones with blues, greys, and neon highlights. Focus on natural and artificial light interplay. | Scene 1 |
| **Amy watching the couple** | Close-up | Capture Amy's contemplative expression. Use soft lighting to highlight emotional depth and introspection. | Scene 1 |
| **Boardwalk with Ren and Summer** | Tracking shot | Vibrant scene with dynamic lighting. Maintain the cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio with futuristic elements subtly present. | Scene 2 |
| **Hackers' Loft** | Wide shot | Sleek, modern, and slightly futuristic style. Use a mix of natural and artificial light to cast dynamic shadows. | Scene 3 |
| **Beach - Aerial View** | Aerial shot | A broad view in cinematic 16:9 format. Blend cool and warm tones to highlight the contrast between natural and urban environments. | Scene 4 |

Please confirm if this shot list aligns with your vision for "Afterglow," or if there are any adjustments you would like to make before we proceed to image generation in Step 3.
