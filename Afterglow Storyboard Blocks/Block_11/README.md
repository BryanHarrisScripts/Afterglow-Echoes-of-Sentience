## AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"

### ECHOES OF FAMILIARITY
**Block 11 - v9**

### EXT. SANTA CRUZ BOARDWALK - DAY
_Ren and Summer walk rhythmically towards the enticing roller coaster. Unseen in the crowd, Amy watches._

**AMY (V.O):**  
"Ren, do not be nervous. Remember, fear is only temporary, but regret can last forever."

### EXT. SANTA CRUZ ROLLER COASTER - DAY
_At the entrance, Ren drums his jittery fingers on the barrier. He sneaks a glance at the broken timepiece in his bag, then turns to Summer's infectious smile._

**REN:**  
"So, straight from the ground to 'The Rocket,' huh?"

_Her eyes sparkle with anticipation._

**SUMMER:**  
"Wait till you surf a wave with me. That's the ultimate high."

**REN:**  
"I've had my share of thrills, believe me."

**SUMMER:**  
"What's one more then?"

**REN:**  
"Well, it's the unknown that follows, that concerns me."

_Ren takes a heavy sigh, looking at Summer._

**REN:**  
"Alright, let's do this."

### EXT. SANTA CRUZ ROLLER COASTER (FRONT CAR) - DAY
_With a deep breath, Ren follows Summer into the front car of the roller coaster. As the safety bar locks into place, Ren grips it tightly. She casts him a reassuring smile._

**SUMMER:**  
"Ren! Embrace the unexpected!"

_Her words echo in his mind. The roller coaster starts to move. He closes his eyes, tightening his grip._

_As the ride begins to ascend, he grips the safety bar tighter, a wave of trepidation washing over him._

**REN:**  
"Summer, there's... something unique about you."

**SUMMER:**  
""Oh, is there now?"

**REN:**  
"Yes. A spark...a refreshing change."

_As the coaster plunges, their laughter is swept away by the rush of the wind. When the ride halts, Ren appears contemplative, a hint of melancholy in his eyes._

### EXT. SANTA CRUZ BOARDWALK - DAY
_They disembark, laughter echoing in the air. Ren looks at Summer, his eyes gleaming with unshed tears. His color returns, he meets her gaze, his smile more relaxed._

**SUMMER:**  
"How was that? Intense, huh?"

**REN:**  
"It was a wake-up callâ€¦"

**SUMMER:**  
"You kept your eyes shut most of the time!"

**REN:**  
"They're open now."

**SUMMER:**  
"What's this, Ren? The ride get to you?"

**REN:**  
"No, just... your laughter, it's familiar."

**SUMMER:**  
"Familiar?"

**REN:**  
"You bring to mind someone... someone I once knew."

_Ren's gaze becomes distant, his mind wandering to his past. A moment later, he shakes his head, regaining his composure._

**REN:**  
"Today, I feel like I've rediscovered a part of myself. Your joy... it's infectious."

_Taken aback by his newfound openness, she smiles warmly. Their chuckles blend with the lively energy of the boardwalk._

### EXT. SANTA CRUZ BEACH - DAY
_As they navigate through the crowd, Ren's laughter fades. Noticing his sudden quietness, she gently touches his arm._

**SUMMER:**  
"Sometimes, the past can feel comforting."

**REN:**  
"Summer, you take me back to... happier times."

**REN (V.O):**  
"My past haunts me...today feels rejuvenating, a fresh start."

_She offers a supportive nod._

_In the distance, Jai closes a truck door, hiding a mysterious device inside. He walks away, leaving the bustling pier behind._
