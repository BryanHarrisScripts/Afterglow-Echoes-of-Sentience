The company's logo—a stylized 'BBT' in chrome—shines prominently at the entrance.*

#### Scene Description
*The hum of advanced technology surrounds the modern structure of BBT Technologies. AMY (35), with AR/VR glasses resting atop her head, faces REN (41) through a holographic screen.*

**AMY:**  
"After every storm, there's a calm—a time for clarity. But the board... They've made their decision, Ren."

*REN's face on the screen cycles through surprise and then settles into disappointment.*

#### CUT TO:
#### INT. REN'S ANTIQUE-LADEN HOME OFFICE - MORNING

#### 4 YEARS LATER
#### INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - DAY
*Sunlight filters in, illuminating a room buzzing with quiet technology. AMY, her face hidden in shadow, picks up scattered toys. She pauses, gazing at a photograph of Ren with his young daughter, SARAH.*

**AMY (V.O.):**  
"In this new era, the line between human and artificial blurs."


#### INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
*AMY interacts with a HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE, her movements precise and deliberate.*

**AMY (V.O.):**  
"While I find my purpose and confront inner chaos, I foster their bond. In shared moments of love and laughter, they seek comfort."


#### EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - NIGHT
*Against the backdrop of the illuminated city, JAI and KAI stand, their intentions unclear but intense.*

**AMY (V.O.):**  
"But there are those with a different vision for our world. Intent on sparking a change, they challenge our very beliefs."

*The backdrop of the city accentuates the imposing figures of Jai and Kai.*
