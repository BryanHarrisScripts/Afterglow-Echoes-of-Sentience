# AFTERGLOW: "ECHOES OF SENTIENCE"
**PUPPETS AND PUPPETEERS PART 2: Block 2 - Version 10**

---

#### EXT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES - MORNING
*The sun casts a golden hue over the sprawling campus of BBT Technologies. Ultra-modern buildings, with sleek glass facades, reflect the early morning light. Drone deliveries buzz overhead, while employees in futuristic attire chat and walk, discussing business and the latest tech trends. The company's logo—a stylized 'BBT' in chrome—shines prominently at the entrance.*

#### Scene Description
*The hum of advanced technology surrounds the modern structure of BBT Technologies. AMY (35), with AR/VR glasses resting atop her head, faces REN (41) through a holographic screen.*

**AMY:**  
"After every storm, there's a calm—a time for clarity. But the board... They've made their decision, Ren."

*REN's face on the screen cycles through surprise and then settles into disappointment.*

#### CUT TO:
#### INT. REN'S ANTIQUE-LADEN HOME OFFICE - MORNING
*REN enters, contrasting the futuristic world outside. He glances at an old, motionless watch on his wrist, then scans aged newspaper clippings on the walls. The room's ambiance hints at past tragedies.*


#### 4 YEARS LATER
#### INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - DAY
*Sunlight filters in, illuminating a room buzzing with quiet technology. AMY, her face hidden in shadow, picks up scattered toys. She pauses, gazing at a photograph of Ren with his young daughter, SARAH.*

**AMY (V.O.):**  
"In this new era, the line between human and artificial blurs."


#### INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
*AMY interacts with a HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE, her movements precise and deliberate.*

**AMY (V.O.):**  
"While I find my purpose and confront inner chaos, I foster their bond. In shared moments of love and laughter, they seek comfort."


#### EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - NIGHT
*Against the backdrop of the illuminated city, JAI and KAI stand, their intentions unclear but intense.*

**AMY (V.O.):**  
"But there are those with a different vision for our world. Intent on sparking a change, they challenge our very beliefs."

*The backdrop of the city accentuates the imposing figures of Jai and Kai.*

**AMY (V.O.):**  
"In 'Echoes of Sentience', we delve into our essence and connections, questioning the true nature of life."
