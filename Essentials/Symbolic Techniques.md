# Storytelling Symbolic Techniques in Screenplays

Symbols have been an integral part of storytelling for as long as tales have been told. They're visual, they're visceral, and they're versatile. In film, their power is immeasurable. Symbolism can be used to add depth to your narrative, build tension, or foreshadow events. Here are some key symbolic techniques used in screenplays.

**1. Subtext:** Subtext is the unspoken or less obvious meaning or message in a literary composition, drama, speech, or conversation. It can provide depth to the characters and plot. A classic example of subtext is in "Jaws" where the shark represents the protagonist's fear of the unknown and inability to control his surroundings.

**2. Foreshadowing:** Foreshadowing is a hint of what's to come. It creates anticipation and heightens the tension. The infamous line "I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore" from "The Wizard of Oz" is an early foreshadowing of the fantastical and strange events to come.

**3. Visual Storytelling:** A picture is worth a thousand words, and in a film, each frame can tell a part of the story. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is an excellent example of visual storytelling where every shot is meticulously crafted to tell a piece of the story, from the bleak desert landscapes to the vibrant, chaotic, and dangerous car chases.

**4. Motifs:** Motifs are recurring elements that have symbolic significance to the story. In "The Godfather", the motif of oranges is seen before death or danger, signifying the impending doom.

**5. Symbolism:** Symbolism can be used to represent ideas or qualities by giving them symbolic meanings that are different from their literal sense. In "American Beauty", the red rose is a recurring symbol that signifies beauty, desire, and passion in the midst of suburban banality.

Understanding these techniques can help you, as a screenwriter, add depth and intrigue to your narrative. Keep them in your toolkit as you craft your cinematic stories.

# Diving Deeper into Screenwriting

### Advanced Symbolic Techniques

Now that we've covered some fundamental symbolic techniques, let's dive deeper into screenwriting symbolism. 

**1. Repeated Symbolic Actions:** Repeated actions can become symbolic over time. In "Casablanca," for instance, Rick’s habitual line, “Play it, Sam” repeats throughout the film. This recurring action underscores his longing for Ilsa and his past.

**2. Color Symbolism:** Colors can convey a spectrum of emotions and themes. For instance, in "The Sixth Sense," the color red is used to indicate anything in the real world that has been touched by the supernatural.

**3. Symbolic Sounds and Music:** Sound can also carry symbolic weight. The sound of Darth Vader's breathing in "Star Wars," for instance, symbolizes his mechanical, inhuman nature. Similarly, musical themes can symbolize characters or ideas, such as the famous two-note motif in "Jaws" that comes to symbolize the approaching shark.

**4. Mirror Characters:** These are characters who reflect aspects of the protagonist, often symbolizing what they could become or what they are afraid of being. In "Black Swan," the two ballerinas are mirror characters, symbolizing innocence and sensuality respectively.

**5. Objects as Symbols:** An object can have symbolic meaning. In "Citizen Kane," the sled named "Rosebud" symbolizes Kane's lost childhood innocence and happiness.

**6. Metaphoric Setting:** Sometimes, the environment or setting of the film can symbolize a theme or idea. In "The Shining," the Overlook Hotel serves as a metaphor for Jack's madness.
The blog posts cover a comprehensive range of symbolic techniques in screenwriting, from the basic to the more advanced. However, there are a few additional points that could be included for an even more detailed examination:

**7. Symbolic Dialogue:** The words a character says can carry symbolic weight. If a line of dialogue is repeated, or if a character often talks about a certain topic, this can serve to symbolize their mindset, their desires, or their flaws.

**8. Allegory:** This is a narrative in which characters, settings, and events stand for abstract concepts, moral qualities, or historical figures and events. The entire story serves as a symbol. For instance, George Orwell's "Animal Farm" is an allegory of the Russian Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union's dictatorial regime.

**9. Symbolic Character Names:** Names can be imbued with symbolic meaning. For example, in "To Kill a Mockingbird," the character named Scout is often going out to explore or discover things, just like a scout would do.

**10. Archetypes:** These are universal symbols that evoke deep responses in a reader/viewer, regardless of their individual circumstances. They are derived from the collective unconscious and are the basis of what Carl Jung considered to be the constituents of the mythmaking process.

**11. Irony:** Irony is a form of expression in which the intended meaning is the opposite of what is stated, often implying humor or sardonic intent. Dramatic irony, where the audience knows more than the characters, can often involve symbols that the characters interpret incorrectly.

These advanced techniques require a careful and delicate touch but can add layers of meaning to your screenplay. Remember, subtlety is key; your audience doesn’t need to immediately recognize all the symbols you’ve incorporated. But upon reflection or repeated viewings, these symbolic techniques can greatly enhance the resonance and depth of your narrative.
