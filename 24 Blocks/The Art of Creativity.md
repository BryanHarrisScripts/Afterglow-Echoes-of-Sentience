# 24 Blocks - The Art of Creativity
When I wrote the script for 'Afterglow' back in 2017, I was blissfully unaware that this creative adventure would later serve the exploration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its interplay with screenwriting. This exploration, which evolved into the 'Afterglow Project,' was aimed at unearthing how AI (editing) could be seamlessly woven into the art of creating captivating screen narratives. In this endeavour, I chose to leverage my narrative framework known as 'Blocks.'

### Introduction: Exploring the 'Blocks' System

Welcome, we dive into the 'Blocks' system, an approach to screenwriting. This technique stands as a blueprint for narrative sequencing and pacing, providing a strategy for both amateur and seasoned writers. Operating in a field where an equilibrium between imagination and structure is crucial, this method offers an enticing solution. The Blocks system dissects the screenplay into 24 distinct blocks, with each block approximately representing five minutes or five pages of the script. This method presents a visual and segmented lens for crafting a story, emphasizing the tempo and sequence of events rather than being solely focused on character development.

### Emphasizing Sequence and Pacing: The 'Blocks' Approach

Unlike character-focused methodologies, such as John Truby's "22 Steps," the Blocks system underscores the importance of the sequence of events and pacing. It provides a visually segmented approach to crafting a story that can accommodate the unique rhythm and beats of individual narratives. This technique employs a pre-planned outline with each block serving as a progress marker guiding the narrative's progression. The transition from one block to the next ensures the narrative structure remains digestible and engaging.

Far from being restrictive, this approach offers a structured pathway that aids idea generation and narrative construction. By breaking down the narrative into manageable Blocks, the trajectory of the story, from the opening page to the 120th or anywhere in between, becomes easier to navigate. The Blocks system, a flexible blueprint, assists in crafting compelling narratives by simplifying the storytelling process. The critical aspect isn't rigidly adhering to the Blocks but utilizing them as handy tools to intuitively and efficiently mold the story.

### Summary: The 'Blocks' System in Review

In this post, we have ventured into a unique approach to screenwriting: the Blocks system. This technique dissects the narrative into 24 distinct blocks, each approximating to about five minutes or five pages of the script. The Blocks system emphasizes the sequence and pacing of events, providing a visually segmented approach to crafting a story. The essence of this method lies in its structured flexibility, steering the narrative's progression without imposing rigid restrictions. The Blocks system could serve as a potent tool, lending a fresh dimension to your storytelling process and offering new insights into narrative construction.

### The Flexibility of the Creative Process

This method might not resonate with everyone. Some may find it restrictive, while others might find it liberating. If it assists in storytelling, that's fantastic! If not, an abundance of published techniques on screen structure, character arcs, dialogue, and more are at your disposal. The allure of the creative process lies in its subjectivity, in the individualistic approach each creator adopts. The Blocks system worked for me, and it might work for you.

In the creative sphere, the objective is to exhibit the diversity of human experiences and perspectives. This diversity adds depth and authenticity to our narratives. Creativity should be an inclusive process, reflecting our varied cultures, ideas, and beliefs. We shouldn't shy away from difficult conversations; instead, our art should stimulate dialogue and challenge the status quo.

While doing so, it's important
