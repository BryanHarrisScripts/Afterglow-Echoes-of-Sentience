# 24 Blocks - A New Spin on Screenwriting

Hey there! Let me introduce you to something I stumbled upon while writing the script for 'Afterglow' back in 2017. I ended up crafting a method that I called 'Blocks', and you know what? It turned out to be a great tool for writing scripts! It works for me!

#### What's with the 'Blocks' System?

So, what's the deal with this 'Blocks' system? It's a technique that makes the screenplay writing process easier, especially when you're trying to balance your wild imagination with some sort of order and structure. The 'Blocks' system breaks down your script into 24 chunks or 'blocks'. Think of each block as a mini-story that moves your entire narrative forward. 

#### Why Blocks? 

Well, it's all about pacing and sequencing your story. While we all love characters (and they're super important!), this method helps to plan out how your events will unfold and at what rhythm. Each block is like a signpost on your storytelling journey, guiding you along your narrative path. 

Don't worry; this isn't a rigid system that chains your creativity. Think of it more like a helpful guide that keeps you on track, makes sure you don't get lost, and helps you pace your story to keep your audience on the edge of their seats.

#### Give It a Go!

There you have it, the 'Blocks' system in a nutshell. It's a fun, visual way to construct your screenplay and might just give you some new insights into your storytelling process. Remember, it's just a tool, so use it if it works for you, tweak it to suit your style, or drop it if it's not your cup of tea. 

#### It's All About Diversity

Ultimately, the magic of creativity lies in our unique perspectives. Our narratives should reflect the rich tapestry of our experiences, ideas, and beliefs. So, whether it's the 'Blocks' method or something else, the important thing is to create art that challenges, questions, and celebrates the diversity of human life.

Feel free to dive in, explore, and collaborate in this space. Let's learn, grow, and create compelling stories together using whatever tools and methods work best for us.
