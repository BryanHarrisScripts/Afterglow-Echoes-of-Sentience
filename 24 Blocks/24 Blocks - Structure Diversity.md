# Structure Diversity 

Storytelling, in its essence, is the art of communicating events and experiences in a structured manner. While stories traditionally followed a linear progression, an increasing number of narratives today experiment with different structures, including nonlinear ones. This post will explore several story structures and delve into the intricacies of nonlinear narratives, providing useful insights for hobbyists and writers.

## From Linearity to Complexity: Understanding Different Story Structures 

Story structures serve as the backbone of any narrative, providing a framework that guides the sequence of events. Let's delve into some intriguing ones, including nonlinear structures:

1. **Nonlinear Structure:** Nonlinear storytelling presents events out of chronological order, featuring flashbacks, flash-forwards, or parallel storylines that intersect intermittently. Movies such as _Memento_, _Mulholland Drive_, and _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ are classic examples that employ this structure.

2. **Three-Act Structure:** This traditional narrative structure consists of setup (Act 1), confrontation (Act 2), and resolution (Act 3). This structure is omnipresent in Hollywood films.

3. **Hero's Journey:** Popularized by Joseph Campbell, this structure follows a hero on an adventure, battling challenges, and returning home transformed. Films like _Star Wars_, _The Lord of the Rings_, and _The Lion King_ epitomize this structure.

4. **Episodic Structure:** This structure presents the narrative as a series of self-contained episodes or vignettes, with each episode having its own mini-arc while contributing to the overall narrative. Films like _Pulp Fiction_, _Magnolia_, and _Amores Perros_ employ this structure.

5. **Framed Narrative:** This structure uses the main story as a container for one or more embedded stories. _The Princess Bride_ is an excellent example where a grandfather narrates a fairytale, with the main story acting as a frame.

6. **Circular Structure:** This structure concludes a story where it started, creating a sense of closure or repetition. Movies like _Groundhog Day_, _The Prestige_, and _The Great Gatsby_ use this structure to explore themes of repetition and fate.

7. **Rashomon Effect:** This narrative structure involves presenting the same events from multiple perspectives, each providing conflicting accounts of the truth, as seen in the film _Rashomon_. Examples: _Rashomon_, _The Girl on the Train_

8. **Split Narrative:** This structure divides the story into multiple parallel storylines that may or may not intersect, with each narrative strand exploring different characters or events. Examples: _Babel_, _Cloud Atlas_

9. **In Medias Res:** Meaning "in the middle of things," this structure starts the story in the middle of the action, and the preceding events are revealed through flashbacks or exposition. Examples: _Inception_, _Sunset Boulevard_

10. **Unreliable Narrator:** This narrative structure employs a storyteller or protagonist who provides a biased or unreliable account of events, leading the audience to question the accuracy of the narrative. Examples: _Fight Club_, _A Beautiful Mind_

11. **Kishōtenketsu:** A traditional East Asian narrative structure that focuses on four acts—Introduction (ki), Development (shō), Twist (ten), and Conclusion (ketsu)—without relying on conflict or resolution as in Western storytelling. Examples: _Spirited Away_, _Pulp Fiction_

These narrative structures offer fresh ways to tell stories and engage the audience.

## Crafting Nonlinear Screenplays: The 24-Block Structure 

Nonlinear storytelling allows for complexity, suspense, varying perspectives, and thematic exploration. By manipulating time and narrative structure, filmmakers can engage audiences in unique ways, as demonstrated by movies like _Pulp Fiction_, _Memento_, _Inception_, and _Cloud Atlas_.

Consider a nonlinear screenplay that uses a 4-act structure, with each act divided into six 5-minute blocks. These blocks can be arranged non-chronologically to align with the story's structure and pacing. Here's a potential arrangement for the 24 blocks:


| Act               | Block            | Content                                          |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Act 1             | Block 1          | Introduction to Character A                      |
|                   | Block 2          | Introduction to Character B                      |
|                   | Block 3          | Introduction to Setting X                        |
|                   | Block 4          | Initial conflict for Character A                 |
| Act 2             | Block 5          | Resolution for Character B's conflict            |
|                   | Block 6          | Flashback revealing Character A's backstory      |
|                   | Block 7          | Character A and Character B meet                 |
|                   | Block 8          | Introduction to Setting Y                        |
| Act 3             | Block 9          | Climactic scene from the middle of the story     |
|                   | Block 10         | Confrontation between Character A and Character B|
|                   | Block 11         | Introduction to Character C                      |
|                   | Block 12         | Character A's realization and change of heart    |
| Act 4             | Block 13         | Resolution for Character A's conflict            |
|                   | Block 14         | Flash-forward to a future event                  |
|                   | Block 15         | Introduction to Setting Z                        |
|                   | Block 16         | Climactic scene from the end of the story        |
| Act 1 (continued) | Block 17         | Character C's backstory                          |
|                   | Block 18         | Initial conflict for Character C                 |
| Act 2 (continued) | Block 19         | Character A's encounter with Character C         |
|                   | Block 20         | Resolution for Character C's conflict            |
|                   | Block 21         | Introduction to Setting W                        |
| Act 3 (continued) | Block 22         | Climactic scene involving all three characters   |
|                   | Block 23         | Resolution for Character A and Character B's conflict |
|                   | Block 24         | Conclusion and final scene                       |


This arrangement is just a possible illustration. The specific order and content of each block would depend on your narrative, offering a flexible approach to nonlinear storytelling.

From conventional structures to fragmented narratives, the art of storytelling continues to evolve, providing filmmakers and writers with varied ways to weave their tales. As we continue exploring this art, the possibilities seem endless, bounded only by the limits of our imagination.
