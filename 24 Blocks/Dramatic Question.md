**Dramatic Question in Screenwriting and the 24-Block Process**

If you're a budding screenwriter, the craft may sometimes feel overwhelmingly vast. One foundational concept is the "dramatic question." This question essentially underpins the entire narrative: Will the hero save the day? Will the lovers unite? Will the detective solve the mystery?

When integrating the dramatic question into the 24-block process, where a screenplay is divided into 4 acts with 6 blocks per act and each block lasting approximately 5 minutes, it becomes a guiding light. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Introducing the Dramatic Question** 
**Act 1 (Blocks 1-6)**
* **Block 1**: Introduce your protagonist and the world they inhabit. The status quo.
* **Block 2**: An event disrupts the status quo. 
* **Block 3**: The protagonist reacts to this disruption.
* **Block 4**: The stakes become clear. What will be gained or lost?
* **Block 5**: The protagonist makes a choice to pursue a goal.
* **Block 6**: This goal, and the obstacles in its path, solidify the dramatic question. 

### 2. **Exploring and Complicating the Dramatic Question**
**Act 2 (Blocks 7-12)**
* **Block 7**: Our protagonist takes initial steps to achieve the goal.
* **Block 8**: Obstacles emerge. The journey isnâ€™t as simple as it seems.
* **Block 9**: New allies and enemies might appear.
* **Block 10**: The protagonist's commitment is tested.
* **Block 11**: A significant setback makes the goal seem almost impossible.
* **Block 12**: A twist or revelation reshapes the journey.

**Act 3 (Blocks 13-18)**
* **Block 13**: The protagonist reassesses their strategy.
* **Block 14**: New plans are set into motion. 
* **Block 15**: Progress is made, but new, more significant obstacles arise.
* **Block 16**: The stakes are heightened, the dramatic question is ever looming.
* **Block 17**: All seems lost, the darkest moment.
* **Block 18**: A glimmer of hope, a new solution, or a last-ditch effort.

### 3. **Answering the Dramatic Question**
**Act 4 (Blocks 19-24)**
* **Block 19**: The final push. Gathering resources, making plans.
* **Block 20**: Confronting the main antagonist or obstacle.
* **Block 21**: The climax. The dramatic question is on the brink of being answered.
* **Block 22**: The immediate fallout of the climax. 
* **Block 23**: The world starts to return to a new equilibrium.
* **Block 24**: The dramatic question is conclusively answered. The narrative closes with a reflection on the journey.

Throughout this journey, the dramatic question remains the anchor, reminding viewers what's at stake. By addressing it consistently across your screenplay, you ensure that the audience remains engaged, rooting for your protagonist, and eager to see how the story unfolds.

So, whether you're a student, teacher, hobbyist, or new screenwriter, always remember the dramatic question is the heart of your story. Shape it well, and let it guide your narrative from the opening scene to the final fade out.
