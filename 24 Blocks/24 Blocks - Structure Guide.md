# Structure Guide: Blocks in Four-Acts

### Introduction

Screenwriting often adheres to the conventional three-act format. This guide introduces an alternative approach, the four-act structure. This method divides each act into six blocks, each designed to propel the story and cultivate character development. This adaptable structure can cater to a wide range of genres and narratives, resulting in a well-structured and engaging screenplay.

The four-act structure is a storytelling tool used in novels, plays, films, and TV series. It's based on classic storytelling principles, following a setup, confrontation, complication, and resolution progression. Each act is characterized by a key narrative function, collectively forming a dramatic narrative arc:

- Act 1: Setup - Establishes characters, their objectives, and the setting.
- Act 2: Confrontation - Explores main conflicts, often increasing challenges for the protagonist.
- Act 3: Complication - Introduces additional problems or obstacles, escalating the situation towards the climax.
- Act 4: Resolution - Concludes the storyline, resolves main conflicts, and provides an ending to the characters' journeys.

In the context of a screenplay, the four-act structure divides each act into six blocks, which could be approximately five minutes in screen time. Below is a template using this structure:
