# The Art of Crafting Loglines: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Every script begins with a single line: the logline. This is a concise, compelling summary of your screenplay's plot in one to two sentences. It is a screenwriter's first opportunity to grab the reader's attention and, as such, it can make or break a script's chance at success. Today, we'll delve into the art of crafting loglines, providing a 20-step guide to perfecting your own, along with examples from top box office hits for a clearer understanding.

## Crafting the Perfect Logline: A 20-Step Guide

Creating an effective logline can seem intimidating, but with these 20 tips, you can master the process:

1. **Define Your Story's Core**: Understand and convey the central theme or concept of your screenplay in your logline.
   
2. **Characterize**: Identify and describe the protagonist, highlighting their key characteristics or personal challenges they must overcome.
   
3. **Present the Conflict**: Clearly indicate the central conflict or problem that the protagonist will face.
   
4. **Describe the Setting**: If the story unfolds in a unique or compelling setting, ensure to include it in the logline.
   
5. **Define the Stakes**: Clarify what's at stake for the protagonist if they fail to resolve the conflict.
   
6. **Keep it Brief**: A logline should ideally be one to two sentences long. The aim is to spark curiosity, not narrate the whole story.
   
7. **Avoid Industry Jargon**: Use plain, universally understood language.
   
8. **Show, Don't Tell**: Rather than explaining, create a vivid image of the screenplay in the reader's mind.
   
9. **Infuse Intrigue**: The logline should compel the reader to want to explore your script further.
   
10. **Don't Give Away the Ending**: Like a trailer, a logline sets up the story but doesn't reveal the ending.
   
11. **Genre Indication**: Give a hint of the screenplay’s genre – whether it's comedy, drama, horror, etc.
   
12. **Use Active Voice**: Active voice is more engaging and makes the logline more exciting.
   
13. **Irony Works Well**: Irony can provide an intriguing twist in loglines, making them more compelling.
   
14. **Use Specificity**: Avoid vague descriptions and use specific details to make your logline stand out.
   
15. **Avoid Character Names**: Unless dealing with famous historical figures or established characters, names are less crucial in a logline and can distract.
   
16. **Highlight the Unique Aspect**: What makes your screenplay different? This unique aspect should be evident in your logline.
   
17. **Revise and Polish**: First drafts aren’t perfect. Refine your logline until it's the best it can be.
   
18. **Seek Feedback**: Have others read your logline and provide feedback to gain new perspectives.
   
19. **Consider the Audience**: Keep your intended audience in mind, thinking about what would entice them to read or watch your story.
   
20. **Convey Tone**: The tone of the script, whether it's a dark thriller or a light-hearted comedy, should be conveyed in your logline.

## Top Box Office Loglines: Examples and Deconstruction

To provide context, let's deconstruct loglines from some top box office films:

**"Titanic"** 
_Logline_: A young man of low social status and a wealthy woman fall in love aboard the ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.
_Deconstruction_: The central theme is a forbidden love story set against the backdrop of a historical disaster, with high stakes underscored by the impending doom of the Titanic.

**"Star Wars: A New Hope"**
_Logline_: A young farm boy discovers he is destined to be a galactic savior, joining forces with an eclectic group to battle an evil empire.
_Deconstruction_: The logline introduces the protagonist's journey from a farm boy to a galactic savior, the main conflict against an evil empire, and a unique setting in a galaxy far, far away.

**"Jurassic Park"**
_Logline_: On an island theme park, genetically engineered dinosaurs break free and wreak havoc, pushing a group of visitors to survive.
_Deconstruction_: The logline presents a unique setting (an island theme park), a unique problem (genetically engineered dinosaurs breaking free), and high stakes (survival).

Crafting a logline is a critical part of the screenwriting process. It requires practice, revision, and feedback. So take your time, experiment, and remember: your logline is the first impression of your story. Make it count.

## Prompt

Hello, aspiring screenwriters! I'm here to assist you in crafting a brief but powerful logline for your screenplay. A logline is a one to two-sentence summary of your script's plot that should pique the reader's curiosity. Included will be the logline and deconstruction so you understand how I created the logline based on your information.

Here's what I need to know:

The Core of Your Story: What's the central theme or concept?
Character Information: Who's the protagonist and what personal challenge must they overcome?
The Conflict: What major problem does your protagonist face?
The Setting: Is there a unique or compelling setting?
The Stakes: What's at risk for your protagonist?
The Unique Aspect: What sets your screenplay apart?
Tone of the Script: Is it a thriller, a comedy, or something else?

Is that too long for a logline? Can you deconstruct it with a shorter logline?
