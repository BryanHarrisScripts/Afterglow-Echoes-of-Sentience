**FADE IN:**



### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES BOARDROOM - MORNING



The room, sleek and dominated by chrome and glass, buzzes with muted

conversations. At the head of the long table


stands AMY, her form strikingly human, yet with a subtle metallic sheen. Her

eyes, windows to advanced circuitry,


scan the room.



**AMY**


Good morning, everyone.


We are here to discuss the future direction of BBT."



As she speaks, a HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY activates, showcasing early designs of

humanoid AIs, with AMY at the forefront.



**AMY**


My creation marked a significant leap for BBT.


However, my human-likeness raised concerns."



**FLASHBACK TO (4 YEARS EARLIER)**



### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES LAB - NIGHT



REN, deeply engrossed, makes final adjustments to AMY, who lies inert on a

table. JAI and KAI enter, their


expressions a mix of awe and concern.



**JAI**


She's too... human, Ren.



**KAI**


People won't accept this. It's too soon.



REN, defiant


She's the future.



### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES BOARDROOM - MORNING



**AMY**


Jai and Kai's concerns led to modifications in subsequent models. But

unbeknownst to them, Ren created two


more like meâ€”Claire and Sarah."



The holographic display shifts, revealing images of CLAIRE and SARAH, their

designs closely resembling AMY's.



**AMY**


Today's decision, however, carries weight beyond business strategy. It's a

pivotal moment, for me and BBT.



A door slides open, revealing JAI and KAI. Their expressions are stern, yet

there's a hint of apprehension.



**JAI**


Ren's vision, while groundbreaking, challenges societal norms. And today, we

make a decision that will


shape our company's legacy."



AMY, her voice steady but with an underlying emotion



I understand the gravity of this moment. Let's proceed.



### INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES CORRIDOR - LATER



JAI and KAI, engaged in a hushed conversation, make their way down the corridor.

Their path is lit by ambient


blue lights, creating an atmosphere of secrecy.



KAI (whispering)


The police and military see potential in our humanoid AIs. They're not just

tools for society; they could


be invaluable for surveillance and defense."



JAI (nods)


It's a new era, Kai. Our creations could be the bridge between technology and

societal safety. But we must


tread carefully."



**KAI**


We've always believed our actions are for the greater good. But we must be

prepared for the challenges ahead.
